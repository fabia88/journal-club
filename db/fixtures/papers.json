    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is the one of the most common and malignant cancers worldwide. LncRNA taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) was initially identified as a transcript upregulated by taurine, and the abnormal expression of TUG1 has been reported in many cancers. However, the biological role and molecular mechanism of TUG1 in PC still needs further investigation.METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to measure the expression of TUG1 in PC cell lines and tissues. MTT and colony formation assays were used to measure the effect of TUG1 on cell proliferation. A wound healing assay, transwell assay and western blot assay were employed to determine the effect of TUG1 on cell migration and the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) and a biotin-avidin pulldown system were performed to confirm the interaction between miR-328 and TUG1. A gene expression array analysis using clinical samples and RT-qPCR suggested that enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) was a target of miR-382 in PC.RESULTS: In this study, we reported that TUG1 was overexpressed in PC tissues and cell lines, and high expression of TUG1 predicted poor prognosis. Further experiments revealed that overexpressed TUG1 promoted cell proliferation, migration and contributed to EMT formation, whereas silenced TUG1 led to opposing results. Additionally, luciferase reporter assays, an RIP assay and an RNA-pulldown assay demonstrated that TUG1 could competitively sponge miR-382 and thereby regulate EZH2.CONCLUSION: Collectively, these findings revealed that TUG1 functions as an oncogenic lncRNA that promotes tumor progression, at least partially, by functioning as an endogenous 'sponge' and competing for miR-382 binding to the miRNA target EZH2.",

    "abstract": "The increasing use of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is based on its capability to perform biventricular function assessment and tissue characterization without radiation and with high reproducibility. The use of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) gave the potential of non-invasive biopsy for fibrosis quantification. However, LGE is unable to detect diffuse myocardial disease. Native T1 mapping and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) provide knowledge about pathologies affecting both the myocardium and interstitium that is otherwise difficult to identify. Changes of myocardial native T1 reflect cardiac diseases (acute coronary syndromes, infarction, myocarditis, and diffuse fibrosis, all with high T1) and systemic diseases such as cardiac amyloid (high T1), Anderson-Fabry disease (low T1), and siderosis (low T1). The ECV, an index generated by native and post-contrast T1 mapping, measures the cellular and extracellular interstitial matrix (ECM) compartments. This myocyte-ECM dichotomy has important implications for identifying specific therapeutic targets of great value for heart failure treatment. On the other hand, T2 mapping is superior compared with myocardial T1 and ECM for assessing the activity of myocarditis in recent-onset heart failure. Although these indices can significantly affect the clinical decision making, multicentre studies and a community-wide approach (including MRI vendors, funding, software, contrast agent manufacturers, and clinicians) are still missing.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cardiotoxicity is a predominant side-effect of nilotinib during chronic myeloid leukemia treatment. The underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. The role of autophagy and mitochondrial signaling was investigated in nilotinib-treated cardiac H9C2 cells.METHODS: Cytotoxicity was assessed using Cell Death Detection kit. Immunoblot and immunofluorescence staining was performed, and cathepsin B and caspase3 activity was assessed in nilotinib-treated H9C2 cells with or without distinct pathway inhibitor or specific siRNA.RESULTS: Nilotinib time- and dose-dependently induced H9C2 apoptosis, which was not completely prevented by the pan caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Following nilotinib treatment, mitochondrial membrane potential decreased significantly accompanied with remarkable morphological changes. Nuclear translocation of mitochondrial apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) and increased p53 was detected in nilotinib-treated cells. AIF knockdown prevented nilotinib-induced increase of p53 and apoptosis. Additionally, increased cathepsin B activity was detected, and inhibition of cathepsin B by CA-074Me prevented nilotinib-induced apoptosis and nuclear translocation of AIF. Moreover, increased Atg5 and transition of LC3-I to LC3-II was revealed following nilotinib treatment. Increased cathepsin B activity and apoptosis by nilotinib was significantly prohibited by specific autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A and Atg5 knockdown.CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that nilotinib increases autophagy and cathepsin B activity, leading to mitochondrial AIF release and nuclear translocation, which is responsible for p53 and apoptosis induction in H9C2 cells.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that may facilitate the selective elimination of tumor cells. The tumor suppressor p53 (TP53) has been demonstrated to promote ferroptosis via a transcription-dependent mechanism. Here, we show that TP53 limits erastin-induced ferroptosis by blocking dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP4) activity in a transcription-independent manner. Loss of TP53 prevents nuclear accumulation of DPP4 and thus facilitates plasma-membrane-associated DPP4-dependent lipid peroxidation, which finally results in ferroptosis. These findings reveal a direct molecular link between TP53 and DPP4 in the control of lipid metabolism and may provide a precision medicine strategy for the treatment of colorectal cancer by induction of ferroptosis.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies play a crucial role in host defense and are indispensable research tools, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Antibody generation involves binding of genomically encoded germline antibodies followed by somatic hypermutation and in vivo selection to obtain antibodies with high affinity and selectivity. Understanding this process is critical for developing monoclonal antibodies, designing effective vaccines, and understanding autoantibody formation. Prior studies have found that antibodies to haptens, peptides, and proteins evolve from polyspecific germline antibodies. The immunological evolution of antibodies to mammalian glycans has not been studied. Using glycan microarrays, protein microarrays, cell binding studies, and molecular modeling, we demonstrate that therapeutic antibodies to the tumor-associated ganglioside GD2 evolved from highly specific germline precursors. The results have important implications for developing vaccines and monoclonal antibodies that target carbohydrate antigens. In addition, they demonstrate an alternative pathway for antibody evolution within the immune system that is distinct from the polyspecific germline pathway.",

However, its role in macrophages remains elusive. We report that pharmacologic inhibition of GS skews M2-polarized macrophages toward the M1-like phenotype, characterized by reduced intracellular glutamine and increased succinate with enhanced glucose flux through glycolysis, which could be partly related to HIF1α activation. As a result of these metabolic changes and HIF1α accumulation, GS-inhibited macrophages display an increased capacity to induce T cell recruitment, reduced T cell suppressive potential, and an impaired ability to foster endothelial cell branching or cancer cell motility. Genetic deletion of macrophagic GS in tumor-bearing mice promotes tumor vessel pruning, vascular normalization, accumulation of cytotoxic T cells, and metastasis inhibition. These data identify GS activity as mediator of the proangiogenic, immunosuppressive, and pro-metastatic function of M2-like macrophages and highlight the possibility of targeting this enzyme in the treatment of cancer metastasis.",

Still, little is known about differential HIF regulation in stem versus bulk glioma cells. We show that the intracellular domain of stem cell marker CD44 (CD44ICD) is released at hypoxia, binds HIF-2α (but not HIF-1α), enhances HIF target gene activation, and is required for hypoxia-induced stemness in glioma. In a glioma mouse model, CD44 was restricted to hypoxic and perivascular tumor regions, and in human glioma, a hypoxia signature correlated with CD44. The CD44ICD was sufficient to induce hypoxic signaling at perivascular oxygen tensions, and blocking CD44 cleavage decreased HIF-2α stabilization in CD44-expressing cells. Our data indicate that the stem cell marker CD44 modulates the hypoxic response of glioma cells and that the pseudo-hypoxic phenotype of stem-like glioma cells is achieved by stabilization of HIF-2α through interaction with CD44, independently of oxygen.",

    "abstract": "At the root of most fatal malignancies are aberrantly activated transcriptional networks that drive metastatic dissemination. Although individual metastasis-associated genes have been described, the complex regulatory networks presiding over the initiation and maintenance of metastatic tumors are still poorly understood. There is untapped value in identifying therapeutic targets that broadly govern coordinated transcriptional modules dictating metastatic progression. Here, we reverse engineered and interrogated a breast cancer-specific transcriptional interaction network (interactome) to define transcriptional control structures causally responsible for regulating genetic programs underlying breast cancer metastasis in individual patients. Our analyses confirmed established pro-metastatic transcription factors, and they uncovered TRIM25 as a key regulator of metastasis-related transcriptional programs. Further, in vivo analyses established TRIM25 as a potent regulator of metastatic disease and poor survival outcome. Our findings suggest that identifying and targeting keystone proteins, like TRIM25, can effectively collapse transcriptional hierarchies necessary for metastasis formation, thus representing an innovative cancer intervention strategy.",

    "abstract": "Sporadic mitochondrial DNA mutations serve as clonal marks providing access to the identity and lineage potential of stem cells within human tissues. By combining quantitative clonal mapping with 3D reconstruction of adult human prostates, we show that multipotent basal stem cells, confined to discrete niches in juxta-urethral ducts, generate bipotent basal progenitors in directed epithelial migration streams. Basal progenitors are then dispersed throughout the entire glandular network, dividing and differentiating to replenish the loss of apoptotic luminal cells. Rare lineage-restricted luminal stem cells, and their progeny, are confined to proximal ducts and provide only minor contribution to epithelial homeostasis. In situ cell capture from clonal maps identified delta homolog 1 (DLK1) enrichment of basal stem cells, which was validated in functional spheroid assays. This study establishes significant insights into niche organization and function of prostate stem and progenitor cells, with implications for disease.",

    "abstract": "In the developing brain, neurons expressing VEGF-A and blood vessels grow in close apposition, but many of the molecular pathways regulating neuronal VEGF-A and neurovascular system development remain to be deciphered. Here, we show that miR-9 links neurogenesis and angiogenesis through the formation of neurons expressing VEGF-A. We found that miR-9 directly targets the transcription factors TLX and ONECUTs to regulate VEGF-A expression. miR-9 inhibition leads to increased TLX and ONECUT expression, resulting in VEGF-A overexpression. This untimely increase of neuronal VEGF-A signal leads to the thickening of blood vessels at the expense of the normal formation of the neurovascular network in the brain and retina. Thus, this conserved transcriptional cascade is critical for proper brain development in vertebrates. Because of this dual role on neural stem cell proliferation and angiogenesis, miR-9 and its downstream targets are promising factors for cellular regenerative therapy following stroke and for brain tumor treatment.",

LCs can be subdivided into estrogen receptor (ER)(+) and ER(-) cells. LCs act as the cancer cell of origin in different types of mammary tumors. It remains unclear whether the heterogeneity found in luminal-derived mammary tumors arises from a pre-existing heterogeneity within LCs. To investigate LC heterogeneity, we used lineage tracing to assess whether the ER(+) lineage is maintained by multipotent SCs or by lineage-restricted SCs. To this end, we generated doxycycline-inducible ER-rtTA mice that allowed us to perform genetic lineage tracing of ER(+) LCs and study their fate and long-term maintenance. Our results show that ER(+) cells are maintained by lineage-restricted SCs that exclusively contribute to the expansion of the ER(+) lineage during puberty and their maintenance during adult life.",

    "abstract": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are essential components of the cancer microenvironment and play critical roles in the regulation of tumor progression. Optimal therapeutic intervention requires in-depth understanding of the sources that sustain macrophages in malignant tissues. In this study, we investigated the ontogeny of TAMs in murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models. We identified both inflammatory monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages as sources of TAMs. Unexpectedly, significant portions of pancreas-resident macrophages originated from embryonic development and expanded through in situ proliferation during tumor progression. Whereas monocyte-derived TAMs played more potent roles in antigen presentation, embryonically derived TAMs exhibited a pro-fibrotic transcriptional profile, indicative of their role in producing and remodeling molecules in the extracellular matrix. Collectively, these findings uncover the heterogeneity of TAM origin and functions and could provide therapeutic insight for PDAC treatment.",

We examined the role of Tet2 in tumor-tissue myeloid cells and found that Tet2 sustains the immunosuppressive function of these cells. We found that Tet2 expression is increased in intratumoral myeloid cells both in mouse models of melanoma and in melanoma patients and that this increased expression is dependent on an IL-1R-MyD88 pathway. Ablation of Tet2 in myeloid cells suppressed melanoma growth in vivo and shifted the immunosuppressive gene expression program in tumor-associated macrophages to a proinflammatory one, with a concomitant reduction of the immunosuppressive function. This resulted in increased numbers of effector T cells in the tumor, and T cell depletion abolished the reduced tumor growth observed upon myeloid-specific deletion of Tet2. Our findings reveal a non-cell-intrinsic, tumor-promoting function for Tet2 and suggest that Tet2 may present a therapeutic target for the treatment of non-hematologic malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a critical tumor suppressor complex responsible for the inactivation of various oncogenes. Recently, PP2A reactivation has emerged as an anticancer strategy. Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A), an endogenous inhibitor of PP2A, is upregulated in many cancer cells, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. We demonstrated that the antihelminthic drug niclosamide inhibited the expression of CIP2A and reactivated the tumor suppressor PP2A in NSCLC cells. We performed a drug-repurposing screen and identified niclosamide as a CIP2A suppressor in NSCLC cells. Niclosamide inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor sphere formation, and induced mitochondrial dysfunction through increased mitochondrial ROS production in NSCLC cells; however, these effects were rescued by CIP2A overexpression, which indicated that the antitumor activity of niclosamide was dependent on CIP2A. We found that niclosamide increased PP2A activity through CIP2A inhibition, which reduced the phosphorylation of several oncogenic proteins. Moreover, we found that a niclosamide analog inhibited CIP2A expression and increased PP2A activity in several types of NSCLC cells. Finally, we showed that other well-known PP2A activators, including forskolin and FTY720, did not inhibit CIP2A and that their activities were not dependent on CIP2A. Collectively, our data suggested that niclosamide effectively suppressed CIP2A expression and subsequently activated PP2A in NSCLC cells. This provided strong evidence for the potential use of niclosamide as a PP2A-activating drug in the clinical treatment of NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Mast cells play a central role in the pathogenesis of allergic reaction. Activation of mast cells by antigens is strictly dependent on the influx of extracellular calcium that involves a complex interaction between signalling molecules located within the cells. We have previously reported that tHGA, an active compound originally isolated from a local shrub known as Melicope ptelefolia, prevented IgE-mediated mast cell activation and passive systemic anaphylaxis by suppressing the release of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α from activated rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL)-2H3 cells. However, the mechanism of action (MOA) as well as the molecular target underlying the mast cell stabilising effect of tHGA has not been previously investigated. In this study, DNP-IgE-sensitised RBL-2H3 cells were pre-treated with tHGA before challenged with DNP-BSA. To dissect the MOA of tHGA in IgE-mediated mast cell activation, the effect of tHGA on the transcription of IL-4 and TNF-α mRNA was determined using Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) followed by Calcium Influx Assay to confirm the involvement of calcium in the activation of mast cells. The protein lysates were analysed by using Western Blot to determine the effect of tHGA on various important signalling molecules in the LAT-PLCγ-MAPK and PI3K-NFκB pathways. In order to identify the molecular target of tHGA in IgE-mediated mast cell activation, the LAT and LAT2 genes in RBL-2H3 cells were knocked-down by using RNA interference to establish a LAT/LAT2 competition model. The results showed that tHGA inhibited the transcription of IL-4 and TNF-α as a result of the suppression of calcium influx in activated RBL-2H3 cells. The results from Western Blot results revealed that tHGA primarily inhibited the LAT-PLCγ-MAPK pathway with partial inhibition on the PI3K-p65 pathway without affecting Syk. The results from RNAi further demonstrated that tHGA failed to inhibit the release of mediators associated with mast cell degranulation under the LAT/LAT2 competition model in the absence of LAT. Collectively, this study concluded that the molecular target of tHGA could be LAT and may provide a basis for the development of a mast cell stabiliser which targets LAT.",

One prominent feature common in multiple steps is the assembly of high-order structures, especially helical filaments nucleated by upstream molecules, rather than stoichiometric complexes.

    "abstract": "Cocaine addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder characterized by persistent perturbations to an organism's homeostatic processes that result in maladaptive drug seeking. Although considerable attention has been directed at the consequences of neuronal changes following chronic cocaine taking, few studies have examined the role of microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, following chronic cocaine administration. Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) is a molecular pattern receptor that recognizes pathogens, danger signals, and xenobiotics and induces proinflammatory signaling in the central nervous system. TLR4 is generally considered to be expressed primarily by microglia. Here, we used a rodent model of cocaine addiction to investigate the role of TLR4 in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in cocaine seeking. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer cocaine in daily 2-hour sessions for 15 days. Following self-administration, rats underwent extinction training and were tested in a drug-primed reinstatement paradigm. Pharmacological antagonism of TLR4 in the VTA using lipopolysaccharide from the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeiroides (LPS-RS) significantly reduced cocaine-primed reinstatement of drug seeking but had no effect on sucrose seeking. TLR4 activation within the VTA using the TLR4 activator, lipopolysaccharide, was sufficient to moderately reinstate cocaine seeking. We also assessed changes in proinflammatory cytokine expression in the VTA following cocaine self-administration. Cocaine self-administration increased the expression of mRNA for the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1ß, but not tumor necrosis factor alpha, in the VTA. Pharmacological antagonism of the interleukin-1 receptor in the VTA reduced cocaine-primed drug seeking. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that chronic cocaine produces inflammatory signaling that contributes to cocaine seeking.",

    "abstract": "Cancer therapy agents have been used extensively as cytotoxic drugs against tissue or organ of a specific type of cancer. With the better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis and cellular events during cancer progression and metastasis, it is now possible to use targeted therapy for these molecular events. Targeted therapy is able to identify cancer patients with dissimilar genetic defects at cellular level for the same cancer type and consequently requires individualized approach for treatment. Cancer therapy begins to shift steadily from the traditional approach of \"one regimen for all patients\" to a more individualized approach, through which each patient will be treated specifically according to their specific genetic defects. Personalized medicine accordingly requires identification of indicators or markers that guide in the decision making of such therapy to the chosen patients for more effective therapy. Cancer biomarkers are frequently used in clinical practice for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as identification of responsive patients and prediction of treatment response of cancer patient. The rapid breakthrough and development of microarray and sequencing technologies is probably the main tool for paving the way toward \"individualized biomarker-driven cancer therapy\" or \"personalized medicine\". In this review, we aim is to provide an updated knowledge and overview of the current landscape of cancer biomarkers and their role in personalized medicine, emphasizing the impact of genomics on the implementation of new potential targeted therapies and development of novel cancer biomarkers in improving the outcome of cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer patients have a high rate of emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient hospitalizations (IHs) that may be reduced by use of outpatient palliative care services.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the outpatient adult palliative care service at the University of North Carolina (UNC) Hospital, begun in 2008, reduced the frequency of ED visits and IH during a two-year period.DESIGN: The charts of patients with lung cancer or head and neck cancer seen by the supportive care service from 2010 to 2011, and of a contemporaneous set of potential consults that were not seen, were retrospectively reviewed to determine the impact of this care delivery model.SETTING/SUBJECTS: The number of individuals with lung cancer and head cancer seen during this two-year period was 24 and 23, respectively, permitting a statistical analysis from which meaningful conclusions could be drawn.MEASUREMENTS: The frequency of ED visits and IHs for each patient was reviewed. Descriptive statistics were used. Fisher's exact test was used for data categorized into two by two contingency tables. The nonparametric Jonckheere-Terpstra method was used to test for ordered differences across categories.RESULTS: Consultation with supportive care did not decrease overall use of ED visits. Patients with head and neck cancer showed an increase in ED visits (p = 0.08) but a reduction in inpatient admissions (p = 0.0004). In patients with lung cancer, the opposite effect was seen-an increase in inpatient visits (p = 0.02) but a decrease in ED visits. The frequency of ED visits was correlated with distance to the ED (p = 0.02), a finding that has not been noted before.CONCLUSIONS: Further work is needed to define the best model for outpatient palliative care.",

    "abstract": "A survivin-associated radio-adaptive response, characterized by increased radiation resistance or sensitization, was induced by exposure to 5 mGy of ionizing radiation and was correlated to the TP53 mutational status of exposed cells. Ten human cancer lines were investigated: colorectal carcinomas HCT116 and RKO [TP53 wild-type (WT)] and their respective TP53 null isogenic lines; breast adenocarcinomas MCF7 (TP53 WT) and MDA-MB-231 (TP53 Mut); lung carcinomas A549 (TP53 WT) and NCI-H1975 (TP53 Mut); and pancreatic carcinomas Hs766T (TP53 WT) and Panc-1 (TP53 Mut). Radiation induced (5 mGy) changes in the subsequent responses to 2 Gy in a multi-dose paradigm. Effects on radiation sensitivity were associated with changes in survivin's intracellular translocation to the cytoplasm (TP53 WT) or nucleus (TP53 Mut). Survival responses were determined using a colony forming assay. Intracellular localization of survivin was determined by ELISA and correlated with survival response. Two 2 Gy doses had minimal effects on the intracellular translocation of survivin. When preceded 15 min earlier by a 5 mGy exposure, survivin translocated to the cytoplasm in all of the TP53 WT cell lines, and to the nuclei in the TP53 null and Mut cells. All TP53 WT cells were protected (P < 0.001) by 5 mGy exposures, while Mut cells were sensitized (P < 0.001). HCT116 and RKO TP53 WT cells were admixed with their respective isogenic TP53 null counterparts in different proportions: 75% to 25%, 50% to 50% and 25% to 75%, respectively. All mixed confluent cultures expressed enhanced radio-sensitization (P ≤ 0.047) characteristic of TP53 Mut cells, which could be inhibited by their exposure to the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) indicating a role for intercellular signaling by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS signaling in propagating the survivin-mediated response is involved in both intra- and intercellular communication processes.",

    "abstract": "Overexpression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) has been considered a primary cause for multidrug resistance in a variety of cancers for three decades. However, clinical translation of Pgp targeted therapeutics has been hindered by lack of patient preselection based on the Pgp presence in tumors. We aim to develop a molecularly targeted probe for imaging tumoral Pgp in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET) and fluorescence, and to provide a tool for preselecting the patients with tumoral Pgp expression. Thus, a Pgp monoclonal antibody 15D3 was chemically modified with IRDye800 (IR800) and DOTA chelator. The specificity of the antibody conjugates DOTA-Pab-IR800 was evaluated in Pgp-expressing 3T3-MDR1 and control 3T3 cells. After radiolabeling with 64Cu, the probe was applied in small animal PET imaging of Pgp in a mouse xenograft model of NCI/ADR-Res cells, which are chemoresistant through overexpression of Pgp. Quantification analysis of the PET images demonstrated that the tumor uptake of the radioactive probe was 9.9 ± 1.4, 12.1 ± 1.2, and 10.5 ± 1.0%ID/g at 4, 24, and 48h post injection. The tumor-to-muscle ratio was 20.9 at 48 h post injection based on biodistribution studies. Fluorescence imaging was performed following PET experiments, and it demonstrated excellent tumor accumulation of this dual-modality probe in the NCI/ADR-Res tumors. Further, an image-guided surgery was performed successfully using the fluorescence modality of the probe, demonstrating potential utility of this probe in image-guided surgical removal of Pgp-positive drug resistant tumors in the patients. In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrated that the Pgp-targeted antibody probe, 64Cu-DOTA-Pab-IR800, could provide a promising diagnosis tool for detection of Pgp-expressing tumors in vivo.",

Since night work and shorter sleep durations have been linked to increased risks of breast cancer, we examined if 24-hour, or day- or night-time traffic noise exposure may also increase the risk of breast cancer. Methods To investigate the noise-related risks of breast cancer, the pseudonymized insurance records of three large statutory health companies (2005-2010) for women aged ≥40 years living in the region surrounding the Frankfurt international airport were analyzed with address-specific acoustic data representing aircraft, road, and rail-traffic noise. Noise exposure among women with incident breast cancer (N=6643) were compared with that of control subjects (N=471 596) using logistic regression and adjusting for age, hormone replacement therapy, education and occupation (only available for 27.9%), and a regional proportion of persons receiving long-term unemployment benefits as an ecological indicator of socioeconomic level. Analyses were also stratified according to estrogen receptor (ER) status. Results An increased odds ratio (OR) was observed for ER negative tumors at 24-hour aircraft noise levels 55-59 dB [OR 55-59 dB 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.90] but not for ER positive breast cancers (OR 55-59 dB 0.95, 95% CI 0.75-1.20). Clear associations between road and rail traffic noise were not observed. Conclusions The results indicate increased aircraft noise may be an etiologic factor for ER negative breast cancers. However, information regarding potential confounding factors was largely unattainable. Further research is required to understand how environmental noise may be involved in the pathogenesis of ER negative breast cancers.",

    "abstract": "Licorice (Glycyrrhiza) species have been widely used as a traditional medicine and a natural sweetener in foods. The 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18β-GA) is a bioactive compound in licorice that exhibits potential anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-microbial activities. Many synthesized derivatives of 18β-GA have been reported to be cytotoxic and suggested for the treatment of malignant diseases. In this study, we explored the possible pharmacological roles of an 18β-GA derivative in skin biology using primary human dermal fibroblasts and HaCaT keratinocytes as cell models. We found that this 18β-GA derivative did not cause cell death, but significantly enhanced the proliferation of dermal fibroblasts and HaCaT keratinocytes. A scratch wound healing assay revealed that the 18β-GA derivative promoted the migration of fibroblasts. Due to the important role of aquaporin-3 in cell migration and proliferation, we also investigated the expression of aquaporin-3 and found this compound up-regulated the expression of aquaporin-3 in dermal fibroblasts and HaCaT keratinocytes. In dermal fibroblasts, the 18β-GA derivative induced the phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, and p38. The inhibitor of Akt predominantly suppressed the 18β-GA derivative-induced expression of aquaporin-3. Collectively, this compound had a positive effect on the proliferation, migration, and aquaporin-3 expression of skin cells, implying its potential role in the treatment of skin diseases characterized by impaired wound healing or dermal defects.",

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are rare, highly aggressive sarcomas that can occur spontaneously or from pre-existing plexiform neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis type1 (NF1) patients. MPNSTs have high local recurrence rates, metastasize easily, are generally resistant to therapeutic intervention and frequently fatal for the patient. Novel targeted therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Standard treatment for patients presenting with advanced disease is doxorubicin based chemotherapy which inhibits the actions of the enzyme topoisomerase IIα (TOP2A). Recent molecular studies using murine models and cell lines identified the bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4) and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) as novel targets for MPNST treatment. We investigated the expression and potential use of BRD4, EZH2 and TOP2A as therapeutic targets in human NF1-derived MPNSTs. The transcript levels of BRD4, EZH2 and TOP2A were determined in paired formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) neurofibroma/MPNST samples derived from the same NF1 patient and in a set of plexiform neurofibromas, atypical neurofibromas and MPNST. We further examined the effect on cell viability of genetic or pharmacological inhibition of BRD4, EZH2 and TOP2A in an MPNST cell line panel. Our results indicated that in MPNST samples BRD4 mRNA levels were not upregulated and that MPNST cell lines were relatively insensitive to the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1. We corroborated that EZH2 mRNA expression is increased in MPNST but failed to confirm its reported pivotal role in MPNST pathogenesis as EZH2 knockdown by siRNA did not interfere with cellular proliferation and viability. Finally, the relation between TOP2A levels and sensitivity for doxorubicin was examined, confirming reports that TOP2A mRNA levels were overexpressed in MPNST and showing that MPNST cell lines exhibited relatively high TOP2A protein levels and sensitivity to doxorubicin. We tentatively conclude that the potential for effective therapeutic intervention in MPNST by targeting BRD4, EZH2 and TOP2A individually, may be limited. Clinical studies are necessary to ultimately prove the relevance of BRD4 and EZH2 inhibition as novel therapeutic strategies for MPNST.",

    "abstract": "Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences at linear chromosome termini, protecting chromosomes against end-to-end fusion and damage, providing chromosomal stability. Telomeres shorten with mitotic cellular division, but are maintained in cells with high proliferative capacity by telomerase. Loss-of-function mutations in telomere-maintenance genes are genetic risk factors for cirrhosis development in humans and murine models. Telomerase deficiency provokes accelerated telomere shortening and dysfunction, facilitating genomic instability and oncogenesis. Here we examined whether telomerase mutations and telomere shortening were associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) secondary to cirrhosis. Telomere length of peripheral blood leukocytes was measured by Southern blot and qPCR in 120 patients with HCC associated with cirrhosis and 261 healthy subjects. HCC patients were screened for telomerase gene variants (in TERT and TERC) by Sanger sequencing. Age-adjusted telomere length was comparable between HCC patients and healthy subjects by both Southern blot and qPCR. Four non-synonymous TERT heterozygous variants were identified in four unrelated patients, resulting in a significantly higher mutation carrier frequency (3.3%) in patients as compared to controls (p = 0.02). Three of the four variants (T726M, A1062T, and V1090M) were previously observed in patients with other telomere diseases (severe aplastic anemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and cirrhosis). A novel TERT variant, A243V, was identified in a 65-year-old male with advanced HCC and cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and alcohol ingestion, but direct assay measurements in vitro did not detect modulation of telomerase enzymatic activity or processivity. In summary, constitutional variants resulting in amino acid changes in the telomerase reverse transcriptase were found in a small proportion of patients with cirrhosis-associated HCC.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The correlation of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) with in-hospital morbidity is important in hospital settings where broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents are routinely used, such as in Greece. The C. DEFINE study aimed to assess point-prevalence of CDI in Greece during two study periods in 2013.METHODS: There were two study periods consisting of a single day in March and another in October 2013. Stool samples from all patients hospitalized outside the ICU aged ≥18 years old with diarrhea on each day in 21 and 25 hospitals, respectively, were tested for CDI. Samples were tested for the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase antigen (GDH) and toxins A/B of C. difficile; samples positive for GDH and negative for toxins were further tested by culture and PCR for the presence of toxin genes. An analysis was performed to identify potential risk factors for CDI among patients with diarrhea.RESULTS: 5,536 and 6,523 patients were screened during the first and second study periods, respectively. The respective point-prevalence of CDI in all patients was 5.6 and 3.9 per 10,000 patient bed-days whereas the proportion of CDI among patients with diarrhea was 17% and 14.3%. Logistic regression analysis revealed that solid tumor malignancy [odds ratio (OR) 2.69, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18-6.15, p = 0.019] and antimicrobial administration (OR 3.61, 95% CI: 1.03-12.76, p = 0.045) were independent risk factors for CDI development. Charlson's Comorbidity Index (CCI) >6 was also found as a risk factor of marginal statistical significance (OR 2.24, 95% CI: 0.98-5.10). Median time to CDI from hospital admission was shorter with the presence of solid tumor malignancy (3 vs 5 days; p = 0.002) and of CCI >6 (4 vs 6 days, p = 0.009).CONCLUSIONS: The point-prevalence of CDI in Greek hospitals was consistent among cases of diarrhea over a 6-month period. Major risk factors were antimicrobial use, solid tumor malignancy and a CCI score >6.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Primary malignant mediastinal germ cell tumors (MMGCTs) are rare in children and adolescents and have a poorer prognosis than their gonadal counterparts. We report a single institutional experience of a 10-year period of primary advanced MMGCTs treated with chemotherapy, followed by radiotherapy in those who had residual mass.METHODS: Children and adolescents with primary advanced MMGCTs between 2005 and 2014 were identified from the Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University. Medical records were reviewed for clinicopathological characteristics, treatments, and outcomes.RESULTS: Twenty-four children and adolescents with either stage III or IV primary advanced MMGCTs met the inclusion criteria. There were 23 males and one female with a median age of 16 (range 10-18). Seven cases were seminomas (29.2%); four (16.7%) yolk sac tumors (YST); three (12.5%) choriocarcinomas; and ten (41.6%) nonteratomatous combined germ cell tumors (CGCTs). All patients were treated with first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (PEB: 19, VIP: 5). Thirteen (54.2%) and Twelve (50%) patients received surgery and radiotherapy, respectively. With a median follow-up of 46.2 months (range 9.6-124.8 months), a total of five (20%) patients died of disease progression; the five-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 82.3% and 64.9%, respectively.-Seven patients with seminoma GCTs received post-chemotherapy irradiation were alive with sustained CR (5-year OS and DFS, 100%, respectively). Five patients with NSGCTs were administered irradiation and one relapsed 35 months later and died of metastasis (5-year OS, 100%; 5-year DFS 66.7%).

However, paratubular basement membrane insudative lesions (PTBMIL) have not attracted much attention, and the association between such lesions and the renal prognosis remains unclear.METHODS: Among 142 patients with biopsy-proven DN and type 2 diabetes encountered from 1998 to 2011, 136 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients were classified into 3 groups (Group 1: mild, Group 2: moderate, Group 3: severe) according to the extent of cortical and medullary PTBMIL. The endpoint was a decline of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by ≥ 40% from baseline or commencement of dialysis for end-stage renal disease. The Cox proportional hazard model was employed to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) for the death-censored endpoint.RESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 1.8 years (IQR: 0.9-3.5), the endpoint occurred in 104 patients. Baseline mean eGFR was 43.9 ± 22.8 ml/min/1.73 m2, and 125 patients (92%) had overt proteinuria. After adjusting for known indicators of DN progression, the HR for the endpoint was 2.32 (95% CI: 1.20-4.51) in PTBMIL Group 2 and 3.12 (1.48-6.58) in PTBMIL Group 3 versus PTBMIL Group 1. Furthermore, adding the PTBMIL Group to a multivariate model including known promoters of DN progression improved prediction of the endpoint (c-index increased by 0.02 [95% CI: 0.00-0.04]).CONCLUSIONS: PTBMIL may be useful for predicting the renal prognosis of patients with biopsy-proven DN, but further investigation of these lesions in various stages of DN is needed.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Animal agriculture has exponentially grown in recent decades in response to the rise in global demand for meat, even in countries like Italy that traditionally eat a Mediterranean, plant-based diet. Globalization related dietary changes are contributing to the epidemic of non-communicable diseases and to the global climate crisis, and are associated with huge carbon and water footprints. The objective of the study is to assess inequalities in health impacts and in attributable greenhouse gases-GHG emissions in Italy by hypothesizing different scenarios of reduction in red and processed meat consumption towards healthier consumption patterns more compliant with the recommendations of the Mediterranean food pyramid.METHODS: We used demographic and food consumption patterns from national surveys and risk relationships between meat intake and cardiovascular and colorectal cancer mortality from IARC and other meta-analyses. From the baseline data (year 2005-2006, average 406 gr/week beef and 245 gr/week processed meat), we considered hypothetical meat reduction scenarios according to international dietary guidelines such as the Mediterranean pyramid targets. For each geographical area (Northwest, Northeast, Centre, and South) and gender, we calculated the number of avoidable deaths from colorectal cancer, and cardiovascular disease among the adult population. Moreover, years of life gained by the adult population from 2012 to 2030 and changes in life expectancy of the 2012 birth cohort were quantified using gender-specific life tables. GHG emission reductions under Mediterranean scenario were estimated only for beef by applying the Global Warming Potential (GWP) coefficient to total consumption and to a low carbon food substitution in adult diet.RESULTS: The deaths avoidable (as percentage change compared to baseline) according to the three reduction scenarios for beef consumption were between 2.3% and 4.5% for colorectal cancer, and between 2.1% and 4.0% for cardiovascular disease; higher benefits would be observed in Northwestern areas and among males. In parallel, 5% and 6.4% of colorectal cancer and CVD deaths would be avoided if the Italian population ate the advised quantity of processed meat. Life table analysis suggests that the scenario that is fully compliant with the Mediterranean diet model would save 5 million years of life lost prematurely among men and women over the next 18 years and would increase average life expectancy of future generations by over 7 months. Considering the environmental impact, emissions associated with the actual total intake of beef range from 12,900 to 21,800 Gg CO2 eq; emissions saved according to the Mediterranean scenario are in the range 8000-14000 Gg CO2 eq per year. The per capita reduction is 263 KgCO2eq/year/person with higher reductions in Northwestern and Central areas.CONCLUSIONS: In Italy, scenarios for reducing beef consumption are consistent with significant health and environmental co-benefits on current and future generations. Results support introducing policies to promote healthier behavior towards red and processed meat in the adult population within an overall balanced and healthy dietary pattern. Interventions should address gender, vulnerable population groups, and geographical differences in order to be more effective.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the underlying mechanisms of the well-substantiated platelet hyporeactivity in neonates is of interest given their implications for the clinical management of newborns, a population at higher bleeding risk than adults (especially sick and preterm infants), as well as for gaining insight into the regulatory mechanisms of platelet biology. Transcriptome analysis is useful in identifying mRNA signatures affecting platelet function. However, human fetal/neonatal platelet transcriptome analysis has never before been reported. We have used mRNA expression array for the first time to compare platelet transcriptome changes during development. Microarray analysis was performed in pure platelet RNA obtained from adult and cord blood, using the same platform in two independent laboratories. A high correlation was obtained between array results for both adult and neonate platelet samples. There was also good agreement between results in our adult samples and outcomes previously reported in three different studies. Gene enrichment analysis showed that immunity- and platelet function-related genes are highly expressed at both developmental stages. Remarkably, 201 genes were found to be differentially expressed throughout development. In particular, neonatal platelets contain higher levels of mRNA that are associated with protein synthesis and processing, while carrying significantly lower levels of genes involved in calcium transport/metabolism and cell signaling (including GNAZ). Overall, our results point to variations in platelet transcriptome as possibly underlining the hypo-functional phenotype of neonatal platelets and provide further support for the role of platelets in cellular immune response. Better characterization of the platelet transcriptome throughout development can contribute to elucidate how transcriptome changes impact different pathological conditions.",

    "abstract": "HPV 16 E6 upregulates hTERT expression in lung cancer cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. In this paper, E6, LKB1, SP1, and hTERT mRNA expression levels were detected in brushing cells of patients with lung cancer (n = 106) and with benign lung disease (n = 68) by qRT-PCR. The mRNA expression levels of E6, SP1, and hTERT were significantly increased in the malignant group compared with the benign group (P < 0.01). Conversely, the mRNA expression level of LKB1 was significantly decreased in the malignant group (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the correlation between E6, Sp1, hTERT, and LKB1 was performed, our results indicated that E6, Sp1, and hTERT with positive, but LKB1 with negative correlation (P < 0.01). To investigate the potential relationship between these genes, using double directional genetic manipulation, we showed that overexpression of E6 in H1299 cells down-regulated LKB1 mRNA and protein expression but up-regulated SP1 and hTERT as well as the transcriptional activity of Sp1. In contrast, knockdown of E6 in A549 cells by short-interference RNAs (siRNAs) up-regulated LKB1 expression, but down-regulated SP1 and hTERT expression as well as Sp1 activity. LKB1 loss upregulated both SP1 and hTERT at the protein and mRNA level as well as SP1 activity. To verify that the role of E6 on hTERT was mediated by SP1, siRNA knockdown of SP1 was performed on both H1299 and A549 cell lines. Inhibition of SP1 downregulated hTERT expression. Our results indicate that HPV16 E6 indirectly upregulated the expression of hTERT by inhibition of LBK1 expression and upregulation of Sp1 expression, thus suggesting a HPV-LKB1-SP1-hTERT axis for the tumorigenesis of lung cancer. Our study also provides new evidence to support the critical role of SP1 and LKB1 in the pathogenesis of HPV-related lung cancer, and suggests novel therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of the FibroScan® device in diagnosing liver steatosis, but its usefulness has not been thoroughly appraised. We investigated the usefulness of the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) in detecting and quantifying liver steatosis.METHODS: A prospective analysis was applied to 79 chronic liver disease patients who underwent a liver biopsy, a FibroScan investigation, ultrasonography, and hepatic steatosis index (HSI). The presence and degree of steatosis as measured by the FibroScan device, ultrasonography and HSI were compared with the results for the liver biopsy tissue.RESULTS: There was substantial concordance between the liver biopsy results and the CAP as evaluated by the kappa (κ) index test for detecting liver steatosis (κCAP = 0.77, P<0.001; κultrasonography = 0.60, P<0.001; κHSI = 0.47, P<0.001). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) of the CAP, ultrasonography, and HSI were 0.899 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.826-0.972)], 0.859 (95% CI = 0.779-0.939), and 0.766 (95% CI = 0.655-0.877), respectively. The optimal CAP cutoff value for differentiating between normal and hepatic steatosis was 247 dB/m, which produced sensitivity and specificity values of 91.9% and 85.7%, respectively, as well as a positive predictive value of 85.0% and a negative predictive value of 92.3%.CONCLUSION: The CAP produces results that are highly concordant with those of a liver biopsy in detecting steatosis. Therefore, the CAP is a noninvasive and reliable tool for evaluating liver steatosis, even in the early stages.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We consider a general class of global optimization problems dealing with nonlinear dynamic models. Although this class is relevant to many areas of science and engineering, here we are interested in applying this framework to the reverse engineering problem in computational systems biology, which yields very large mixed-integer dynamic optimization (MIDO) problems. In particular, we consider the framework of logic-based ordinary differential equations (ODEs).METHODS: We present saCeSS2, a parallel method for the solution of this class of problems. This method is based on an parallel cooperative scatter search metaheuristic, with new mechanisms of self-adaptation and specific extensions to handle large mixed-integer problems. We have paid special attention to the avoidance of convergence stagnation using adaptive cooperation strategies tailored to this class of problems.RESULTS: We illustrate its performance with a set of three very challenging case studies from the domain of dynamic modelling of cell signaling. The simpler case study considers a synthetic signaling pathway and has 84 continuous and 34 binary decision variables. A second case study considers the dynamic modeling of signaling in liver cancer using high-throughput data, and has 135 continuous and 109 binaries decision variables. The third case study is an extremely difficult problem related with breast cancer, involving 690 continuous and 138 binary decision variables. We report computational results obtained in different infrastructures, including a local cluster, a large supercomputer and a public cloud platform. Interestingly, the results show how the cooperation of individual parallel searches modifies the systemic properties of the sequential algorithm, achieving superlinear speedups compared to an individual search (e.g. speedups of 15 with 10 cores), and significantly improving (above a 60%) the performance with respect to a non-cooperative parallel scheme. The scalability of the method is also good (tests were performed using up to 300 cores).CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that saCeSS2 can be used to successfully reverse engineer large dynamic models of complex biological pathways. Further, these results open up new possibilities for other MIDO-based large-scale applications in the life sciences such as metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, drug scheduling.",

    "abstract": "The popular Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) software uses the random-effects models for estimating the narrow-sense heritability based on GWAS data of unrelated individuals without knowing and identifying the causal loci. Many methods have since extended this approach to various situations. However, since the proportion of causal loci among the variants is typically very small and GCTA uses all variants to calculate the similarities among individuals, the estimation of heritability may be unstable, resulting in a large variance of the estimates. Moreover, if the causal SNPs are not genotyped, GCTA sometimes greatly underestimates the true heritability. We present a novel narrow-sense heritability estimator, named HERRA, using well-developed ultra-high dimensional machine-learning methods, applicable to continuous or dichotomous outcomes, as other existing methods. Additionally, HERRA is applicable to time-to-event or age-at-onset outcome, which, to our knowledge, no existing method can handle. Compared to GCTA and LDAK for continuous and binary outcomes, HERRA often has a smaller variance, and when causal SNPs are not genotyped, HERRA has a much smaller empirical bias. We applied GCTA, LDAK and HERRA to a large colorectal cancer dataset using dichotomous outcome (4,312 cases, 4,356 controls, genotyped using Illumina 300K), the respective heritability estimates of GCTA, LDAK and HERRA are 0.068 (SE = 0.017), 0.072 (SE = 0.021) and 0.110 (SE = 5.19 x 10-3). HERRA yields over 50% increase in heritability estimate compared to GCTA or LDAK.",

    "abstract": "Microbial anti-cancer enzymes have been proven to be effective and economical agents for cancer treatment. Aeromonas veronii has been identified as a microorganism with the potential to produce L-glutaminase, an anticancer agent effective against acute lymphocytic leukaemia. In this study, a selective medium of Aeromonas veronii was used to culture the microorganism. Strain improvement was done by adaptive and induced mutational techniques. A selective minimal agar media was incorporated for the growth of the strain which further supports adaptive mutation. Strains were also UV-irradiated and successively treated with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine to find a resilient strain capable of producing L-glutaminase efficiently. The Plackett-Burman design and central composite designs were used to screen and optimize additional carbon and nitrogen sources. Adaptive mutation resulted in promising yield improvements compared to native strain (P<0.001). The mean yield of 30 treated colonies from the induced mutation was significantly increased compared to the non-induced strain (P< 0.001). The economically feasible statistical designs were found to reinforce each other in order to maximize the yield of the enzyme. The interactions of nutrient factors were understood from the 3D response surface plots. The model was found to be a perfect fit in terms of maximizing enzyme yield, with the productivity improving at every stage to a fourfold output of enzyme (591.11 ±7.97 IU/mL) compared to the native strain (135±3.51 IU/mL).",

    "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) pose challenges for drug discovery efforts because of the high degree of structural homology in the orthosteric pocket, particularly for GPCRs within a single subfamily, such as the nine adrenergic receptors. Allosteric ligands may bind to less-conserved regions of these receptors and therefore are more likely to be selective. Unlike orthosteric ligands, which tonically activate or inhibit signalling, allosteric ligands modulate physiologic responses to hormones and neurotransmitters, and may therefore have fewer adverse effects. The majority of GPCR crystal structures published to date were obtained with receptors bound to orthosteric antagonists, and only a few structures bound to allosteric ligands have been reported. Compound 15 (Cmpd-15) is an allosteric modulator of the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) that was recently isolated from a DNA-encoded small-molecule library. Orthosteric β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, known as beta-blockers, are amongst the most prescribed drugs in the world and Cmpd-15 is the first allosteric beta-blocker. Cmpd-15 exhibits negative cooperativity with agonists and positive cooperativity with inverse agonists. Here we present the structure of the β2AR bound to a polyethylene glycol-carboxylic acid derivative (Cmpd-15PA) of this modulator. Cmpd-15PA binds to a pocket formed primarily by the cytoplasmic ends of transmembrane segments 1, 2, 6 and 7 as well as intracellular loop 1 and helix 8. A comparison of this structure with inactive- and active-state structures of the β2AR reveals the mechanism by which Cmpd-15 modulates agonist binding affinity and signalling.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells exploit the expression of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) ligand 1 (PD-L1) to subvert T-cell-mediated immunosurveillance. The success of therapies that disrupt PD-L1-mediated tumour tolerance has highlighted the need to understand the molecular regulation of PD-L1 expression. Here we identify the uncharacterized protein CMTM6 as a critical regulator of PD-L1 in a broad range of cancer cells, by using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen. CMTM6 is a ubiquitously expressed protein that binds PD-L1 and maintains its cell surface expression. CMTM6 is not required for PD-L1 maturation but co-localizes with PD-L1 at the plasma membrane and in recycling endosomes, where it prevents PD-L1 from being targeted for lysosome-mediated degradation. Using a quantitative approach to profile the entire plasma membrane proteome, we find that CMTM6 displays specificity for PD-L1. Notably, CMTM6 depletion decreases PD-L1 without compromising cell surface expression of MHC class I. CMTM6 depletion, via the reduction of PD-L1, significantly alleviates the suppression of tumour-specific T cell activity in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide insights into the biology of PD-L1 regulation, identify a previously unrecognized master regulator of this critical immune checkpoint and highlight a potential therapeutic target to overcome immune evasion by tumour cells.",

    "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) are fundamental drivers of the cell cycle and are required for the initiation and progression of various malignancies. Pharmacological inhibitors of CDK4/6 have shown significant activity against several solid tumours. Their primary mechanism of action is thought to be the inhibition of phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor, inducing G1 cell cycle arrest in tumour cells. Here we use mouse models of breast carcinoma and other solid tumours to show that selective CDK4/6 inhibitors not only induce tumour cell cycle arrest, but also promote anti-tumour immunity. We confirm this phenomenon through transcriptomic analysis of serial biopsies from a clinical trial of CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment for breast cancer. The enhanced anti-tumour immune response has two underpinnings. First, CDK4/6 inhibitors activate tumour cell expression of endogenous retroviral elements, thus increasing intracellular levels of double-stranded RNA. This in turn stimulates production of type III interferons and hence enhances tumour antigen presentation. Second, CDK4/6 inhibitors markedly suppress the proliferation of regulatory T cells. Mechanistically, the effects of CDK4/6 inhibitors both on tumour cells and on regulatory T cells are associated with reduced activity of the E2F target, DNA methyltransferase 1. Ultimately, these events promote cytotoxic T-cell-mediated clearance of tumour cells, which is further enhanced by the addition of immune checkpoint blockade. Our findings indicate that CDK4/6 inhibitors increase tumour immunogenicity and provide a rationale for new combination regimens comprising CDK4/6 inhibitors and immunotherapies as anti-cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "The clinical benefit for patients with diverse types of metastatic cancers that has been observed upon blockade of the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 has highlighted the importance of this inhibitory axis in the suppression of tumour-specific T-cell responses. Notwithstanding the key role of PD-L1 expression by cells within the tumour micro-environment, our understanding of the regulation of the PD-L1 protein is limited. Here we identify, using a haploid genetic screen, CMTM6, a type-3 transmembrane protein of previously unknown function, as a regulator of the PD-L1 protein. Interference with CMTM6 expression results in impaired PD-L1 protein expression in all human tumour cell types tested and in primary human dendritic cells. Furthermore, through both a haploid genetic modifier screen in CMTM6-deficient cells and genetic complementation experiments, we demonstrate that this function is shared by its closest family member, CMTM4, but not by any of the other CMTM members tested. Notably, CMTM6 increases the PD-L1 protein pool without affecting PD-L1 (also known as CD274) transcription levels. Rather, we demonstrate that CMTM6 is present at the cell surface, associates with the PD-L1 protein, reduces its ubiquitination and increases PD-L1 protein half-life. Consistent with its role in PD-L1 protein regulation, CMTM6 enhances the ability of PD-L1-expressing tumour cells to inhibit T cells. Collectively, our data reveal that PD-L1 relies on CMTM6/4 to efficiently carry out its inhibitory function, and suggest potential new avenues to block this pathway.",

Clinical findings and lesion imaging features were documented. The contrast-enhanced T1-weighted non-enhancing cystic component of hypoglossal schwannomas was compared with size-matched pathologically proven vestibular schwannomas.RESULTS: Our review identified 40 lesions encroaching on the hypoglossal canal, located within the hypoglossal canal, or found in both locations: 16 hypoglossal schwannomas, 15 juxtaarticular cysts, and nine purely cystic hypoglossal canal lesions. Hypoglossal schwannomas, which were intradural when involving the premedullary cistern, most commonly enhanced heterogeneously, with a thick peripheral enhancing component, a central enhancing component, or both enhancing components. Juxtaarticular cysts encroaching on the hypoglossal canal were extradural, were contiguous with a craniocervical junction synovial joint, and showed thin rim enhancement. Hypoglossal canal nonenhancing cystic lesions were confined to the hypoglossal canal, had signal intensity equivalent to CSF, and lacked any contrast enhancement.CONCLUSION: Although hypoglossal schwannomas, juxtaarticular cysts, and hypoglossal canal nonenhancing cystic lesions may all encroach on or lie within the hypoglossal canal, purely cystic lesions are unlikely to be schwannomas. A diagnostic algorithm applying key imaging and clinical findings allows differentiation of these lesions, which have vastly different treatment regimens.",

Although current literature suggests no premalignant potential of these lesions, it does not fully explain the small but real percentage of these lesions that are upgraded to malignancy after surgical excision. This upgrade phenomenon is probably best explained by core biopsy sampling error. A recommendation minimizing this possibility based on lesion size seems reasonable.",

We chose to study hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity on the basis of the assumption that hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity may indicate the presence of chemotherapy-induced sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS).MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this retrospective study, 104 patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer (male-female ratio, 66:38; age range, 20-80 years) who had undergone OBC and serial CT studies were consecutively registered. Two blinded imagers independently scored CT images using a 5-point scale to determine the severity of newly developed hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity after OBC. Subsequently, two radiologists evaluated tumor response to OBC using a 4-point ordinal scale. We performed generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis using cumulative logits to account for the effect of hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity severity on the cumulative tumor response probability.RESULTS: The interobserver agreements for the severity of hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity were excellent (κ = 0.825). GEE analyses showed that the severity of post-OBC hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity, number of chemotherapy sessions, and presence of other organ metastases were significant predictors of tumor response; these three factors also showed significance in the final GEE model (p < 0.0001 for severity of hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity for both readers; p = 0.011 and 0.010 for the number of chemotherapy sessions for readers 1 and 2; p = 0.046 and 0.012 for the presence of other organ metastases for readers 1 and 2).CONCLUSION: Hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity detected on contrast-enhanced CT of patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer who have undergone OBC may indicate the presence of SOS, and the more severe the SOS, the worse the tumor response of hepatic metastasis to oxaliplatin is expected to be.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess the value of CT texture analysis for prediction of therapeutic response of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with pretherapeutic dynamic CT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 132 HCCs in 96 patients treated with TACE who underwent dynamic CT before initial TACE. Imaging findings and arterial enhancement ratios were analyzed. All HCCs were manually segmented, and their texture features were quantitatively extracted using in-house software. CT texture was quantified with 2D and 3D analysis. HCCs were classified as with and without complete response (CR) according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Predictive factors for CR were assessed with multivariate analysis. Radiologic responses were correlated with time to progression (TTP).RESULTS: Of the 132 HCCs, CR was achieved in 75 (56.8%). Tumor size, subjective arterial tumor attenuation, and arterial enhancement ratios were significantly associated with CR. On 2D and 3D analysis, tumors with CR showed significantly lower homogeneity and higher mean attenuation, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) moments, and CT number percentiles (p < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, higher subjective tumor attenuation (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 23.35), arterial enhancement ratio (OR = 14.07), GLCM moments (OR = 6.57), smaller tumor size (OR = 17.26), and lower homogeneity (OR = 0.69) were significant predictors of CR compared with incomplete response (p < 0.05). Median survival value for TTP was significantly longer in tumors with CR (p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Pretherapeutic dynamic CT texture analysis can be valuable to predict CR of HCC to TACE. Higher arterial enhancement and GLCM moments, lower homogeneity, and smaller tumor size are significant predictors of CR after TACE.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine whether single-phase contrast-enhanced dual-energy quantitative spectral analysis improves the accuracy of diagnosis of small (< 4.0 cm) renal lesions, compared with conventional single-energy attenuation measurements.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 136 consecutive patients (95 men and 41 women; mean age, 54 years) with 144 renal lesions (111 benign and 33 malignant) underwent single-energy unenhanced and dual-energy contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen. For each renal lesion, attenuation measurements were obtained, and an attenuation change of 15 HU or greater was considered evidence of enhancement. Dual-energy spectral attenuation curves were generated for each lesion. The slope of each curve was measured between 40 and 50 keV (λHU40-50), 40 and 70 keV (λHU40-70), and 40 and 140 keV (λHU40-140). Mean lesion attenuation values and spectral attenuation curve parameters were compared between benign and malignant renal lesions by use of the two-sample t test. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed and validated using cross-validation analysis.RESULTS: With the use of cross-validated optimal thresholds at 100% sensitivity, specificity for differentiating between benign and malignant renal lesions improved significantly when both λHU40-70 and λHU40-140 were used, compared with conventional enhancement measurements (93% [103/111; 95% CI, 86-97%] vs 81% [90/111; 95% CI, 73-88%]) (p = 0.02). The sensitivity of λHU40-70 and λHU40-140 was also higher than that of conventional enhancement measurements, although it was not statistically significant.CONCLUSION: Single-phase contrast-enhanced dual-energy quantitative spectral analysis significantly improves the specificity for characterization of small (< 4.0 cm) renal lesions, compared with conventional single-energy attenuation measurements.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To test a simultaneous care model for palliative care for patients with advanced cancer by embedding a palliative care nurse practitioner (NP) in an oncology clinic.METHODS: We evaluated the effect of the intervention in two oncologists' clinics beginning March 2014 by using implementation strategies, including use of a structured referral mechanism, routine symptom screening, integration of a psychology-based cancer supportive care center, implementation team meetings, team training, and a metrics dashboard for continuous quality improvement. After 1 year of implementation, we evaluated key process and outcome measures for supportive oncology and efficiency of the model by documenting tasks completed by the NP during a subset of patient visits and time-motion studies.RESULTS: Of approximately 10,000 patients with active cancer treated in the health system, 2,829 patients had advanced cancer and were treated by 42 oncologists. Documentation of advance care planning increased for patients of the two intervention oncologists compared with patients of the other oncologists. Hospice referral before death was not different at baseline, but was significantly higher for patients of intervention oncologists compared with patients of control oncologists (53% v 23%; P = .02) over the intervention period. Efficiency evaluation revealed that approximately half the time spent by the embedded NP potentially could have been completed by other staff (eg, a nurse, a social worker, or administrative staff).CONCLUSION: An embedded palliative care NP model using scalable implementation strategies can improve advance care planning and hospice use among patients with advanced cancer.",

Here, we review mammalian data addressing the interaction of macroautophagy/autophagy with key signaling cascades associated with tumor inflammation. Although our understanding of this area remains incomplete, certain inflammatory pathways have emerged as important mediators of the crosstalk between autophagy and inflammation in tumors. Consistent with the multifaceted roles for autophagy in tumor cells, results to date support the hypothesis that inflammatory pathways can suppress or induce autophagy in a context-dependent manner; in turn, autophagy suppresses or promotes inflammation in cancers. Furthermore, emerging data suggest that autophagy may influence cytokine production and secretion via diverse mechanisms, which has implications for the immune and inflammatory microenvironment in tumors.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against programmed death 1 (PD-1), were assessed in patients with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-expressing extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) in the multicohort, phase Ib open-label KEYNOTE-028 study ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02054806). Methods Patients with SCLC received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 24 months or until disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurred. PD-L1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. PD-L1-positive patients had membranous PD-L1 expression in ≥ 1% of tumor and associated inflammatory cells or positive staining in stroma. Response was assessed by investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 every 8 weeks for the first 6 months and every 12 weeks thereafter. Adverse events (AEs) were reported per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Primary end points were safety, tolerability, and objective response rate (ORR). Secondary end points included progression-free survival, overall survival, and duration of response. Results Twenty-four patients with PD-L1-expressing SCLC were enrolled and received at least one pembrolizumab dose. At the data cutoff date (June 20, 2016), the median follow-up duration was 9.8 months (range, 0.5 to 24 months). All 24 patients experienced AEs; the most common were asthenia (n = 7), fatigue (n = 7), and cough (n = 6). Two patients experienced grade 3 to 5 treatment-related AEs: one patient had elevated bilirubin, and one patient had asthenia, grade 5 colitis, and intestinal ischemia. One patient had a complete response, and seven patients had partial responses, resulting in an ORR of 33% (95% CI, 16% to 55%). Conclusion The safety of pembrolizumab was consistent with the known safety profile in other tumor types. Pembrolizumab demonstrated promising antitumor activity in patients with pretreated, PD-L1-expressing SCLC.",

    "abstract": "The development of a suitable delivery system and the targeting of intracellular organelles are both essential for the success of drug and gene therapies. The conception of fluorescent ligands, displaying targeting specificity together with low toxicity, is an emerging and reliable tool to develop innovative delivery systems. Biocompatible BSA or pDNA/ligand nanoparticles were synthesized by a co-precipitation method and were shown to display adequate sizes and morphology for delivery purposes, and positive surface charges. Additionally, these fluorescent vectors can target specific intracellular organelles. In vitro transfection mediated by BSA or pDNA based carriers can result in the accumulation of BSA in the cytosol, lysosomes and mitochondria or the expression of the plasmid-encoded protein, respectively. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of pDNA/ligand vectors in cancer gene therapy instigates further research aiming clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to further investigate the cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines and several bacterial strains of Annona squamosa and its mode of action. Methanol extracts of A. squamosa leaves (ASL) and seeds (ASS) were used. ASL showed significant antibacterial activity against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and E. faecalis with MIC values of 78, 78 and 39 µg/mL respectively. Moreover, ASL exhibited significant biofilm disruption, rapid time dependent kinetics of bacterial killing, increased membrane permeability and significantly reduced the cell numbers and viability. Regarding the cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines, ASS was more active against Jurkat and MCF-7 cells, with CI50 1.1 and 2.1 µg/mL, respectively. ASL showed promising activity against Jurkat and HL60, with CI50 4.2 and 6.4 µg/mL, respectively. Both extracts showed lower activity against VERO cells and reduced the clonogenic survival at higher concentrations (IC90) to MCF-7 and HCT-116 lineages. The alkaloids anonaine, asimilobine, corypalmine, liriodenine nornuciferine and reticuline were identified in extracts by UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. This study reinforced that A. squamosa presents a remarkable phytomedicinal potential and revealed that its antimicrobial mechanism of action is related to bacterial membrane destabilization.",

    "abstract": "Many phosphorescent iridium complexes are potent candidates as photodynamic therapeutic agents. In this work, a series of mixed-ligand phosphorescent iridium complexes (Ir1: [Ir(L1)(bpy)Cl](PF6)2; Ir2: [Ir(L1)(ppy)Cl](PF6); Ir3: [Ir(L2)(bpy)Cl](PF6)2; Ir4: [Ir(L2)(ppy)Cl](PF6). L1 = 2,6-bis(2-benzimidazolyl)pyridine; bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine; L2 = 2,6-bis(1-methyl-benzimidazol-2-yl)pyridine; ppy = 2-phenylpyridine) have been synthesized and characterized. These complexes display high luminescence quantum yields and long phosphorescence lifetimes. All the complexes are resistant to hydrolysis in aqueous solutions, and can produce singlet oxygen ((1)O2) effectively upon irradiation. Ir1 and Ir2 show pH-sensitive emission properties. Interestingly, higher cellular uptake efficiency is observed for Ir2 and Ir4 with the cyclometalated ppy ligand in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. Ir2 with pH-sensitive emission properties can selectively image lysosomes, and Ir4 can specifically target mitochondria. Both Ir2 and Ir4 exhibit potent photodynamic therapy (PDT) effects, with Ir2 displaying a higher phototoxicity index (PI) especially in A549 cells (PI > 54). Mechanism studies indicate that Ir2 and Ir4 can induce apoptosis through reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and caspase activation upon visible light (425 nm) irradiation. As expected, Ir2 can damage lysosomes more effectively with a pH-sensitive singlet oxygen ((1)O2) yield, while Ir4 tends to impair mitochondrial function. Nevertheless, the practical application of Ir2 and Ir4 for PDT may be limited to superficial tumors due to the short excitation wavelength (425 nm). Our study gives insights into the design and anticancer mechanisms of new metal-based PDT anticancer agents.",

    "abstract": "Radical cystoprostatectomy (RCP) followed by bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and urinary diversion remains the gold-standard therapy for men with localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Prostate cancer might be incidentally detected at the time of RCP with a reported prevalence of 24-51%. Typically, these patients are considered to have clinically insignificant disease, but data from emerging series challenge this assumption and suggest that some of these tumours might be aggressive, or somehow increase the aggressiveness of the associated MIBC, and can negatively influence the patient's overall survival outcomes. Furthermore, the potential use of prostate-sparing cystectomy in patients with less-aggressive MIBC might lead to newly diagnosed incidental cases of prostate cancer, with characteristics suggestive of clinically significant disease, requiring a specific, separate workup. The development of evidence-based, validated protocols to define the necessary steps for diagnosis of prostate cancer in these patients, including the role of serum PSA testing, digital rectal examination, the role of imaging methods and the indication and type of biopsy protocol, is of major importance to the multidisciplinary management of patients with urological cancer. Finally, the retrospective nature of the available data account for much of the variability in the prevalence of coexisting bladder and prostate cancer and emphasizes the need for randomized trials in this controversial area of urological oncology.",

Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common variant with distinct precancerous lesions before development into invasive disease. Involvement of the inguinal lymph nodes is the most important prognostic factor in PeCa, and once disease is present outside the groin, prognosis is poor. Metastatic PeCa is challenging to treat and often requires multidisciplinary approaches in management. Due to its rarity, molecular understanding of the disease continues to be limited with most studies based on small, single center series. Thus far, it appears PeCa has diverse mechanisms of carcinogenesis affecting similar molecular pathways. In this review, we evaluate the current landscape of the molecular carcinogenesis of PeCa and explore ongoing research on potential actionable targets of therapy. The emergence of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and other immunotherapeutic strategies may improve outcomes for PeCa patients.",

The structures of new glycosides were elucidated by 2D NMR spectroscopy and mass-spectrometry. All the isolated new glycosides were characterized by the non-holostane type lanostane aglycones having 18(16)-lactone and 7(8)-double bond and differed from each other by the side chains and carbohydrate moieties structures. Magnumoside A₁ (1) has unprecedented 20(24)-epoxy-group in the aglycone side chain. Magnumosides of the group A (1-4) contained disaccharide monosulfated carbohydrate moieties, of the group B (5, 6)-tetrasaccharide monosulfated carbohydrate moieties and, finally, of the group C (7-9)-tetrasaccharide disulfated carbohydrate moieties. The cytotoxic activities of the compounds 1-9 against mouse spleen lymphocytes, the ascites form of mouse Ehrlich carcinoma cells, human colorectal carcinoma DLD-1 cells as well as their hemolytic effects have been studied. Interestingly, the erythrocytes were more sensitive to the glycosides action than spleenocytes and cancer cells tested. The compounds 3 and 7 significantly inhibited the colony formation and decreased the size of colonies of DLD-1 cancer cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Moreover, the synergism of effects of radioactive irradiation and compounds 3 and 7-9 at subtoxic doses on proliferation of DLD-1 cells was demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor p53 is a potent tumor suppressor dubbed as the \"guardian of the genome\" because of its ability to orchestrate protective biological outputs in response to a variety of oncogenic stresses. Mutation and thus inactivation of p53 can be found in 50% of human tumors. The majority are missense mutations located in the DNA binding region. Among them, G245S is known to be a structural hotspot mutation. To understand the behaviors and differences between the wild-type and mutant, both a dimer of the wild type p53 (wt-p53) and its G245S mutant (G245S-mp53), complexed with DNA, were simulated using molecular dynamics for more than 1 μs. wt-p53 and G245S-mp53 apo monomers were simulated for 1 μs as well. Conformational analyses and binding energy evaluations performed underline important differences and therefore provide insights to understand the G245S-mp53 loss of function. Our results indicate that the G245S mutation destabilizes several structural regions in the protein that are crucial for DNA binding when found in its apo form and highlight differences in the mutant-DNA complex structure compared to the wt protein. These findings not only provide means that can be applied to other p53 mutants but also serve as structural basis for further studies aimed at the development of cancer therapies based on restoring the function of p53.",

    "abstract": "The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor is known as a master regulator of the cell cycle. RB is mutated or functionally inactivated in the majority of human cancers. This transcriptional regulator exerts its function in cell cycle control through its interaction with the E2F family of transcription factors and with chromatin remodelers and modifiers that contribute to the repression of genes important for cell cycle progression. Over the years, studies have shown that RB participates in multiple processes in addition to cell cycle control. Indeed, RB is known to interact with over 200 different proteins and likely exists in multiple complexes. RB, in some cases, acts through its interaction with E2F1, other members of the pocket protein family (p107 and p130), and/or chromatin remodelers and modifiers. RB is a tumor suppressor with important chromatin regulatory functions that affect genomic stability. These functions include the role of RB in DNA repair, telomere maintenance, chromosome condensation and cohesion, and silencing of repetitive regions. In this review we will discuss recent advances in RB biology related to RB, partner proteins, and their non-transcriptional functions fighting back against genomic instability.",

    "abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common form of Kidney cancer, is characterized by frequent mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene in ~85% of sporadic cases. Loss of pVHL function affects multiple cellular processes, among which the activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway is the best-known function. Constitutive activation of HIF signaling in turn activates hundreds of genes involved in numerous oncogenic pathways, which contribute to the development or progression of ccRCC. Although VHL mutations are considered as drivers of ccRCC, they are not sufficient to cause the disease. Recent genome-wide sequencing studies of ccRCC have revealed that mutations of genes coding for epigenome modifiers and chromatin remodelers, including PBRM1, SETD2 and BAP1, are the most common somatic genetic abnormalities after VHL mutations in these tumors. Moreover, recent research has shed light on the extent of abnormal epigenome alterations in ccRCC tumors, including aberrant DNA methylation patterns, abnormal histone modifications and deregulated expression of non-coding RNAs. In this review, we discuss the epigenetic modifiers that are commonly mutated in ccRCC, and our growing knowledge of the cellular processes that are impacted by them. Furthermore, we explore new avenues for developing therapeutic approaches based on our knowledge of epigenome aberrations of ccRCC.",

    "abstract": "Invasion of the extracellular matrix is a critical step in the colonization of metastatic tumors. The invasion process is thought to be driven by both chemokine signaling and interactions between invading cancer cells and physical components of the metastatic niche, including endothelial cells that line capillary walls and serve as a barrier to both diffusion and invasion of the underlying tissue. Transwell chambers, a tool for generating artificial chemokine gradients to induce cell migration, have facilitated recent work to investigate the chemokine contributions to matrix invasion. These chambers, however, are poorly designed for imaging, which limits their use in investigating the physical cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions driving matrix invasion. Microfluidic devices offer a promising model in which the invasion process can be imaged. Many current designs, however, have limited surface areas and possess intricate geometries that preclude the use of standard staining protocols to visualize cells and matrix proteins. In this work, we present a novel microfluidic platform for imaging cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions driving metastatic cancer cell matrix invasion. Our model is applied to investigate how endothelial cell-secreted matrix proteins and the physical endothelial monolayer itself interact with invading metastatic breast cancer cells to facilitate invasion of an underlying type I collagen gel. The results show that matrix invasion of metastatic breast cancer cells is significantly enhanced in the presence of live endothelial cells. Probing this interaction further, our platform revealed that, while the fibronectin-rich matrix deposited by endothelial cells was not sufficient to drive invasion alone, metastatic breast cancer cells were able to exploit components of energetically inactivated endothelial cells to gain entry into the underlying matrix. These findings reveal novel cell-cell interactions driving a key step in the colonization of metastatic tumors and have important implications for designing drugs targeted at preventing cancer metastasis.",

Lesions are created by repetitive self-inflicted manipulation and trauma of dysaesthetic skin within the trigeminal dermatome. We discuss four cases with aetiologies varied from presumed microvascular compromise to resection of cerebral meningioma, cerebrovascular accident, and herpes zoster ophthalmicus. We discuss the management of the under-recognised associated periocular skin ulcerations that result from physical manipulation of dysesthic skin and prove to be persistent and challenging to treat. Patient education and counselling are crucial in understanding and preventing the detrimental effect of physical manipulation of the skin. Occlusive dressings can reduce recurrent trauma. Topical lubricants, antibiotics, or autologous serum may be needed in cases with corneal involvement or exposure. Surgical interventions may be used, but frequently fail if the underlying neurological pathology and skin manipulation has not been adequately addressed. TTS should be suspected in persistent or recurrent facial ulceration with concomitant anaesthesia and paraesthesia in the trigeminal distribution, with alar nasi involvement being a key feature.",

Patients with enucleation as initial treatment and patients enucleated after plaque brachytherapy were analyzed for demographic data, operative course, and post-enucleation outcome. Further cause analysis for secondary enucleations was investigated. No significant difference was seen in age, laterality, or gender between the primarily enucleated (n = 54) and secondarily enucleated (n = 34) groups. Greater difficulty with surgery was noted in 28/32 (87.5%) of secondary enucleations compared to 1/54 (1.8%) of primary enucleations (p < 0.0001). Operative time was >2 hours in 3/51 (6%) of primary enucleations (vs. 8 of 32, 25%, p = 0.02). Average implant size was similar in the 2 groups (20.6 mm), however 2/34 (6%) of secondary enucleations required dermis fat grafting. Post-enucleation anophthalmic ptosis occurred after 8/49 (16%) of primary cases (vs. 13/30, 43%, p = 0.02) and prosthetic enophthalmos after none (0%) of primary cases (vs. 5/30, 17%, p = 0.006). Class 2 gene expression profile was found in 6/8 (60%) of eyes enucleated for treatment failure. Secondary enucleation performed after plaque brachytherapy was technically more difficult, and had more anophthalmic socket and eyelid complications compared to primary enucleation for uveal melanoma.

We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer treatment.METHODS: Studies published until April 2017 were selected. The pooled effect size was calculated through meta-analysis by using random effects models. Outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (RR), and adverse events (AEs).RESULTS: Six studies examining 1615 patients were included. TKI treatment significantly improved PFS in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.82) and those with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC; HR = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.22-0.58). TKI treatment significantly prolonged OS in patients with DTC (HR = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58-0.95). TKI treatment group exhibited a significantly improved partial response rate (risk ratio = 15.8; 95% CI, 1.77-140.69) but a significantly higher number of AEs compared with control group.CONCLUSION: TKIs significantly improved PFS and RR in patients with advanced or metastatic DTC or MTC. We recommend thoroughly evaluating patients' health status and cautiously using TKIs to maximize their benefits and minimize their toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Optic nerve sheath meningiomas (ONSM) and intra-conal orbital lymphomas are common entities on the differential of a retrobulbar optic nerve involving space-occupying lesion. In this study, we compare the pre-surgical diagnosis, based on clinical presentation and neuroimaging, to the surgical pathology results of intra-conal orbital lymphomas and ONSM. This is an IRB approved retrospective chart review of orbital lymphomas and optic nerve sheath meningiomas biopsied by a single surgeon over a 4-year period at a single institution. Pre-surgical diagnosis and surgical pathology were compared. Fifteen cases of orbital lymphoma were identified. Fourteen were excluded based on extra-conal location. The single histologically confirmed intra-conal orbital lymphoma had a pre-surgical diagnosis of ONSM. Four cases of optic nerve sheath meningioma were identified. Three of the 4 cases of histologically confirmed ONSM had a pre-surgical diagnosis of ONSM. One of the 4 had a pre-surgical diagnosis of lymphoma. Diagnosis based on surgical pathology differed from the pre-surgical diagnosis in 2 out of 5 cases showing that clinical diagnosis does not always correlate with histologic diagnosis. Although both diseases are typically managed with radiation therapy, the treatment dosage and systemic disease implications are very different. These findings emphasis the importance of biopsy in the diagnosis of orbital lesions surrounding the optic nerve.",

The authors present two cases of isolated orbital mucoceles without associated sinus outflow obstruction. There were notably no connections between the paranasal sinuses and the lesions. The mucoceles were diagnosed following orbitotomies and excisional biopsies with confirmatory histopathology. These rare orbital lesions should be considered when evaluating cystic orbital lesions, and the orbital surgeon should be familiar with the proposed pathophysiology and treatment recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Dabrafenib is a kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with specific BRAF variants. Dabrafenib can be used as a single agent to treat melanoma with the BRAF V600E variant, or in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib to treat melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K variants. BRAF is an intracellular kinase in the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway. BRAF is involved in regulating important cell functions such as cell growth, division, differentiation, and apoptosis. BRAF is also a proto-oncogene—when mutated it has the ability to transform normal cells into cancerous cells. Variation in the kinase domain of BRAF have been associated with various cancers. The most common BRAF variant, V600E, constitutively activates the kinase, and causes cell proliferation in the absence of growth factors that would normally be required. The V600E variant is detected in approximately 50% of melanomas (1, 2). The FDA-approved label for dabrafenib states that the presence of BRAF mutation in tumor specimens (V600E for dabrafenib monotherapy; V600E or V600K for dabrafenib plus trametinib) should be confirmed, using an FDA-approved test, before starting treatment with dabrafenib. Dabrafenib is not indicated for treatment of patients with wild-type BRAF melanoma. The label also states that patients who have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency should be monitored for signs of hemolytic anemia while taking dabrafenib (3).",

Mannitol was the main free sugar while malic acid was the most abundant organic acid. δ-Tocopherol was the dominant form of tocopherols with 42.41 μg per 100 g dw. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were predominant, followed by saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. A methanolic extract prepared from these samples was tested for antioxidant, quorum sensing and antimicrobial assays, as well as for its cytotoxicity effects. The extract showed antimicrobial activity against all tested microorganisms, including Candida albicans. Furthermore, when tested at sub-MIC concentration, it showed reduction of virulence factors and biofilm formation against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The extract also exhibited antioxidant activity and did not show toxicity against tumor and non-tumor cells. Due to the observed bioactive properties and compounds of the honey mushroom and its well-balanced nutrients, this mushroom emerges as an interesting functional food and a source of nutraceuticals with applications in different diseases based on antioxidant and antimicrobial effects.",

These complexes are more cytotoxic than cisplatin against the cancer cells screened, can quickly penetrate into A549 cells and are mainly localized in the mitochondria. Mechanism studies show that these complexes exert their anticancer efficacy by increasing the intracellular ROS level, reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and inducing apoptosis. Additionally, Ir1-Ir4 exhibited two orders of magnitude higher cytotoxicity upon irradiation at 450 nm LED light. Our work provides a strategy for the design of highly effective anticancer photodynamic therapeutic agent based phosphorescent iridium complexes.",

    "abstract": "Most differentiated cells convert glucose to pyruvate in the cytosol through glycolysis, followed by pyruvate oxidation in the mitochondria. These processes are linked by the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), which is required for efficient mitochondrial pyruvate uptake. In contrast, proliferative cells, including many cancer and stem cells, perform glycolysis robustly but limit fractional mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation. We sought to understand the role this transition from glycolysis to pyruvate oxidation plays in stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Loss of the MPC in Lgr5-EGFP-positive stem cells, or treatment of intestinal organoids with an MPC inhibitor, increases proliferation and expands the stem cell compartment. Similarly, genetic deletion of the MPC in Drosophila intestinal stem cells also increases proliferation, whereas MPC overexpression suppresses stem cell proliferation. These data demonstrate that limiting mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism is necessary and sufficient to maintain the proliferation of intestinal stem cells.",

    "abstract": "This observational post-marketing study of parenteral testosterone undecanoate (TU) in a non-selected population aimed to: examine the effectiveness of TU as treatment of hypogonadism; record adverse drug reactions (ADR) quantitatively particularly regarding polycythemia, prostate safety and cardiovascular-related metabolic risk factors; and verify whether recommended injection intervals apply to routine clinical practice. Eight hundred and seventy subjects from 259 outpatient units scheduled to visit the clinic six times were included. Effectiveness and tolerability of TU administration were assessed on a 4-point scale. Body weight, waist girth, blood pressure, hemoglobin levels, hematocrit, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and digital rectal prostate examination were assessed. Over 90% of subjects completed the observational duration of 52.8 ± 9.7 weeks (mean ± SD) and 56% judged effectiveness as very good, 30.8% as good. 63.1% judged tolerability as very good, and 24.4% as good. No adverse effects on indicators of cardiovascular risk were observed. Polycythemia occurred in one subject and a supranormal hematocrit in one subject. Four subjects developed supranormal PSA levels. Prostate carcinoma was found in one subject, one subject had recurrence of a previously surgically treated prostate carcinoma, and the other two showed no indication of malignancy. Parenteral TU is safe, effective, and well-tolerated in clinical practice proving a good therapeutic option for hypogonadism.",

    "abstract": "Antiangiogenesis with bevacizumab, an antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been used for devascularization to limit the growth of malignant glioma. However, the benefits are transient due to elusive mechanisms underlying resistance to the antiangiogenic therapy. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are capable of forming vasculogenic mimicry (VM), an alternative microvascular circulation independent of VEGF-driven angiogenesis. Herein, we report that the formation of VM was promoted by bevacizumab-induced macroautophagy/autophagy in GSCs, which was associated with tumor resistance to antiangiogenic therapy. We established a 3-dimensional collagen scaffold to examine the formation of VM and autophagy by GSCs, and found that rapamycin increased the number of VM and enhanced KDR/VEGFR-2 phosphorylation. Treatment with chloroquine, or knockdown of the autophagy gene ATG5, inhibited the formation of VM and KDR phosphorylation in GSCs. Notably, neutralization of GSCs-produced VEGF with bevacizumab failed to recapitulate the effect of chloroquine treatment and ATG5 knockdown, suggesting that autophagy-promoted formation of VM was independent of tumor cell-derived VEGF. ROS was elevated when autophagy was induced in GSCs and activated KDR phosphorylation through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway. A ROS inhibitor, N-acetylcysteine, abolished KDR phosphorylation and the formation of VM by GSCs. By examination of the specimens from 95 patients with glioblastoma, we found that ATG5 and p-KDR expression was strongly associated with the density of VM in tumors and poor clinical outcome. Our results thus demonstrate a crucial role of autophagy in the formation of VM by GSCs, which may serve as a therapeutic target in drug-resistant glioma.",

We found tissues stained with TGF-β showed no significant upregulation within malignant tumors when compared to normal tissue controls. We observed high levels of TGF-β presence in most tissues similar to GAPDH expression. Within both colon adenocarcinoma and metastatic carcinomas there was a significant variability among patients in the expression of IL-10. While some patients experienced insignificant increases in the cytokine compared to controls, other patients had a clear upregulation of the protein within their tissue. In addition, there was an increase in the number of patients positive for IL-10 upregulation within metastatic tumors when compared to primary tumors. These data indicate that there is substantial variability between patients in regards to IL-10 expression, which may further aid in characterizing tumors and evaluating metastatic potential.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the anti-inflammatory effects of nasunin in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264 macrophages and to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. We found that nasunin reduced the LPS-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and nitric oxide, and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in a dose-dependent manner. Nasunin diminished LPS-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation by suppressing the degradation of inhibitor of κB-α and nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of NF-κB. Nasunin also attenuated the phosphorylation of Akt and p38, signaling molecules involved in pro-inflammatory mediator production. Moreover, nasunin inhibited the intracellular accumulation of ROS, leading to the suppression of NF-κB activation, Akt and p38 phosphorylation, and subsequent pro-inflammatory mediator production. These findings suggest that nasunin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect and this effect is mediated, at least in part, by its antioxidant activity.",

These patients were classified into four groups, based on different treatment modes: chemotherapy group, brain radiotherapy group, brain radiotherapy combined with sequential chemotherapy, and chemotherapy combined with sequential brain radiotherapy. Recent and long-term curative effects were compared among the four groups.RESULTS: A RR of 42.57% was determined for all four groups, and median PFS and OS was 11.56 and 17.32 months, respectively. After SCLC with brain metastases manifested in the limited stage, the difference in median survival period was not statistically significant among the four treatment groups (P = 0.29). At the extensive stage of SCLC, survival period was superior in the brain radiotherapy combined with sequential chemotherapy group, compared to other groups (P<0.05). Furthermore, median survival period in the brain radiotherapy combined with sequential chemotherapy group was 15.5 ± 1.03 months. This was followed by 12.0 ± 3.06 months in the chemotherapy combined with sequential brain radiotherapy group, 8.0 ± 1.49 months in the chemotherapy group, and 8.0 ± 0.43 months in the brain radiotherapy group.CONCLUSION: Combining chemotherapy with brain radiotherapy is a better treatment mode compared to single therapy for treating SCLC with brain metastases. Furthermore, it is recommended for patients in the extensive stage to initially receive brain radiotherapy.",

A retrospective analysis of 520 diagnosed orbital tumours who presented to us was carried out and the prevalence of orbital osteoma was determined. The sampling technique was non-randomized sampling. Based on the clinical morphology observed during surgical intervention as well as the radiological findings of the orbital osteoma, a simple yet useful description of orbital osteoma was introduced.RESULTS: The retrospective analysis of 520 diagnosed orbital tumours revealed a prevalence of 2.3% (n = 12) of orbital osteoma. Based on our observation of the 12 (n = 12) cases of orbital osteoma, we have classified orbital osteoma into a combination of seven types: \"sessile\" or broad-based osteoma; \"pedunculated\" or mushroom osteoma with a thin cylindrical stalk of origin; \"dumb-bell\"-shaped osteoma with the simultaneous presence in orbital and adjoining sinus/nasal cavity; \"wrapped\" osteoma, covered by a thin cartilaginous layer; \"naked\" osteoma, without any such covering; \"homogenous\" or uniformly dense osteoma; and \"heterogeneous\", soft-dense osteoma with varying areas of density.CONCLUSION: This study attempts to introduce a simple description of different types of orbital osteoma based on clinical per-operative morphology and radiological findings for the first time to facilitate the surgical removal of orbital osteoma.",

    "abstract": "Representing a novel type of endogenous noncoding RNAs, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have recently gained much attention for their involvement in multiple biological processes. CircRNAs are ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells and modulate gene expression by acting as sponges of microRNAs (miRNAs) or other proteins, such as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Due to their unique structure, circRNAs are more stable than linear RNAs. Expression profiles of circRNAs are associated with clinicopathological characteristics of colorectal cancer patients, such as differentiation, TNM classification and distant metastasis. Furthermore, circRNAs play crucial roles in multiple processes associated with malignant phenotypes, including cell proliferation/cycle, apoptosis and invasion. Improvements in RNA-sequencing methods have helped researchers to elucidate molecular interactions between circRNAs and colorectal cancer. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the features and functions of circRNAs, as well as insights into their roles in the onset and development of colorectal cancer. Combined with the reported results, the identification of circRNAs associated with colorectal cancer will certainly contribute to early detection and help to design treatment strategies for colorectal cancer. Screening for circRNAs may provide an accessible, noninvasive yet highly sensitive diagnosis for colorectal cancer. Furthermore, a better understanding of the roles of circRNAs may also provide a novel predictive feature in colorectal cancer therapy and prognosis.",

The disaggregation of these nanoparticles (NPs) during drug release implies the dispersion of positively charged cytotoxic polyelectrolytes in the human body. To alleviate such issue, we synthesised A(BC)n amphiphilic block copolymers with linear (n = 1) and branched (n = 2) architectures to obtain pH-sensitive vesicles capable of releasing drugs in acidic conditions via controlled swelling instead of disaggregation. We obtained this feature by fine-tuning the relative amount of pH-sensitive and hydrophobic monomers. We studied pH-driven swelling by measuring NPs size in neutral and acidic conditions, the latter typical of tumours or inflamed tissues (pH∼6) and lysosomes (pH∼4.5). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential data provided useful indications about the influence of architecture and chemical composition on NPs swelling, stability and polycation release. Results demonstrated that vesicles made of linear copolymers with ∼22-28% in mol of protonable monomers in the 'BC' block swelled more than other species following a pH change from pH 7.4 to pH 4.5. We finally evaluated the cytotoxicity of vesicles composed of linear species, and paclitaxel (PTX) release from the latter in both cancer and normal cells.",

    "abstract": "Silk nanoparticles are expected to improve chemotherapeutic drug targeting to solid tumours by exploiting tumour pathophysiology, modifying the cellular pharmacokinetics of the payload and ultimately resulting in trafficking to lysosomes and triggering drug release. However, experimental proof for lysosomotropic drug delivery by silk nanoparticles in live cells is lacking and the importance of lysosomal pH and enzymes controlling drug release is currently unknown. Here, we demonstrate, in live single human breast cancer cells, the role of the lysosomal environment in determining silk nanoparticle-mediated drug release. MCF-7 human breast cancer cells endocytosed and trafficked drug-loaded native and PEGylated silk nanoparticles (∼100 nm in diameter) to lysosomes, with subsequent drug release from the respective carriers and nuclear translocation within 5 h of dosing. A combination of low pH and enzymatic degradation facilitated drug release from the silk nanoparticles; perturbation of the acidic lysosomal pH and inhibition of serine, cysteine and threonine proteases resulted in a 42% ± 2.2% and 33% ± 3% reduction in nuclear-associated drug accumulation for native and PEGylated silk nanoparticles, respectively. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of lysosomal activity for anticancer drug release from silk nanoparticles, thereby providing direct evidence for lysosomotropic drug delivery in live cells.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a postoperative complication associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The incidence and risks factors for AKI after cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) have not been fully studied. The purpose of this study was to identify perioperative risk factors predictive of AKI after CRS-HIPEC.METHODS: This retrospective study collected demographic, tumor-related, intraoperative and postoperative data from 475 patients who underwent CRS-HIPECs. AKI was defined using the acute kidney injury network criteria and calculated on postoperative days 1, 2, 3, 7 and day of hospital discharge. We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses to assess the association between variables of interest and AKI. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: The incidence of AKI was 21.3%. The multivariate analysis identified six predictor factors independently associated with the development of AKI (OR: [95%CI]); age: 1.16 (1.05-1.29, p <0.005), BMI (overweight: 1.97 [1.00-3.88], p = 0.05) and obesity: 2.88 (1.47-5.63), p <0.002), preoperative pregabalin: 3.04 (1.71-5.39, p <0.037), platinum-based infusion: 3.04 (1.71-5.39, p <0.001) and EBL: 1.77 (1.27-2.47, p <0.001). Splenectomy had a protective effect (OR: 0.44 (0.25-0.76, p <0.003).CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the incidence of AKI is high. While other studies have reported that AKI is associated with platinum-based infusion, age and obesity, we report for the first time a negative association between pregabalin use and AKI. More studies are needed to confirm our results.",

    "abstract": "Human DNA methyltransferase (MTase) activity expression patterns and inhibition response are linked to related cancer initiation, progression and therapeutic responses. Sensitive and accurate human MTase activity assay in cancer cells, especially at the single-cell level, is essential for biological study, clinical diagnosis and therapy. Here, we developed an ultrasensitive and accurate DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) activity assay at the single-cell level based on a single integrated magnetic microprobe of functionalized double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) anchored to a single magnetic microbead surface. Functionalized dsDNA is designed with a hemimethylated DNA site for Dnmt1 recognition and a single-stranded tail to trigger in situ rolling circle amplification (RCA). Under the action of Dnmt1, hemimethylated dsDNA could be recognized and catalyzed to fully methylated dsDNA, which would protect them from the cleavage of BssHII. But the dsDNA without full methylation would be cut by BssHII, making single-stranded tail separated from the single integrated microprobe. Subsequently, full methylation-protected in situ RCA could be performed and multiple signal probes were hybridized to the single integrated microprobe for amplified signal accumulation. Finally, Dnmt1 activity could be evaluated by reading the fluorescence of the single integrated microprobe. Meanwhile, to minimize matrix interferences, magnetic separation was performed in the process. In this strategy, the single integrated magnetic microprobe was provided with integrated capacities of target recognition, signal amplification, signal accumulation and matrix isolation. Therefore, an ultralow detection limit of 0.007 U/mL Dnmt1 was obtained and accurate Dnmt1 activity assays in multiple cell lysates at the single-cell level were achieved. Furthermore, the inhibition effect of RG108 was evaluated conveniently. These results indicate that the single integrated magnetic microprobe-based strategy is an excellent candidate for sensitive monitoring of Dnmt1 activity and screening of anticancer drugs.",

    "abstract": "The mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), with key roles in recognition and clearance of foreign particles, is a major constraint to nanoparticle-based delivery systems. The desire to improve the delivery efficiency has prompted the search for stealthy long-circulating nanoplatforms. Herein, we design an antiphagocytic delivery system with \"active\" stealth behavior for cancer theranostics combining efficient MRI and enhanced drug delivery. We modify self-peptide, a synthetic peptide for active immunomodulation, to biodegradable poly (lactide-glycolide)-poly (ethylene glycol) (PLGA-PEG), then utilize the self-assembly properties of PLGA-PEG to form nanomicelles that encapsulating iron oxide (IO) nanoparticles and anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX). Through the interaction of self-peptide with the receptor SIRPα, which is expressed on phagocytes, the as-prepared nanomicelles can disguise as \"self\" to avoid being recognized as foreign particles by MPS, leading to improved blood circulation time and delivery efficiency. Compared to the \"passive\" stealth effect generating by PEG or zwitterionic polymers that only passively delay the physisorption of serum proteins to nanocarriers, the \"active self\" nanomicelles can more efficiently inhibit the MPS-mediated immune clearance and reduce \"accelerated blood clearance (ABC)\" phenomenon. Furthermore, this one-step clustering of IO nanoparticles and loading of PTX endow the resulted magneto-nanomicelles with enhanced T2 MRI contrast performance and anti-tumor effect. We believe that this study provides a novel approach in designing of efficient stealth antiphagocytic delivery systems that resisting the MPS-mediated clearance for cancer theranostics.",

All formed NPs were redox-sensitive because of the existence of disulfide bonds in the backbone. The stability of NPs in aqueous media with or without glutathione was systematically evaluated and compared. The optical performance, including fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), was characterized in different conditions for those polymers with fluorescent components. Importantly, all formed NPs showed good cytocompatibility towards HeLa cells, and different biological functions, including drug loading and delivery, bioimaging with variable fluorescence, and photodynamic activity, as evidenced by experiments in vitro and in vivo.

In this study, we aimed to explore Daxx subcellular localization in gastric cancer (GC) cells and correlate the findings with clinical data in GC patients. Seventy pairs of tissue samples (GC and adjacent normal tissue) were analyzed immunohistochemically for Daxx expression and localization (nuclear and cytoplasmic). The Daxx Nuclear/Cytoplasmic ratio (Daxx NCR) values in tissue microarray data with 522 tumor samples were further analyzed. The defined Prior cohort (n = 277, treatment between 2006 and 2009) and Recent cohort (n = 245, treatment between 2010 and 2011) were then used to examine the relationship between Daxx NCR and clinical data. The Daxx NCR was found to be clinically informative and significantly higher in GC tissue. Using Daxx NCR (risk ratio = 2.0), both the Prior and Recent cohorts were divided into high- and low-risk groups. Relative to the low-risk group, the high-risk patients had a shorter disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in both cohorts. Importantly, postoperative chemotherapy was found having differential effect on high- and low-risk patients. Such chemotherapy brought no survival benefit, (and could potentially be detrimental,) to high-risk patients after surgery. Daxx NCR could be used as a prognosis factor in GC patients, and may help select the appropriate population to benefit from chemotherapy after surgery.",

Sex and gender are key determinants of health and disease although unequal care exists between the sexes. Stereotypical male attitudes are shown to lead to poor health outcomes.METHODS: Men with BRCA1/2 mutations and diagnosed with PCa were identified and invited to participate in a qualitative interview study. Data were analysed using a Framework approach. 'Masculinity theory' was used to report the impact of having both a BRCA1/2 mutation and PCa.RESULTS: Eleven of 15 eligible men were interviewed. The umbrella concept of 'Ambiguity in a Masculine World' was evident. Men's responses often matched those of women in a genetic context. Men's BRCA experience was described, as 'on the back burner' but 'a bonus' enabling familial detection and early diagnosis of PCa. Embodiment of PCa took precedence as men revealed stereotypical 'ideal' masculine responses such as stoicism and control while creating new 'masculinities' when faced with the vicissitudes of having two gendered conditions.CONCLUSION: Health workers are urged to take a reflexive approach, void of masculine ideals, a belief in which obfuscates men's experience. Research is required regarding men's support needs in the name of equality of care.",

    "abstract": "Identification of loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression in poorly differentiated (PD) chordoma in pediatric patients suggests that PD chordoma is an entity molecularly distinct from conventional chordoma or atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, which is also characterized by loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression by inactivating mutation of the SMARCB1/INI gene. So far, around 20 cases of pediatric PD chordoma with loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression have been reported. Here, we report two cases of pediatric PD chordoma with loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression, which is very rare among the pediatric chordoma types. Both patients presented clival masses on preoperative MRI. Histologically, both tumors had nonclassic histologic features for conventional chordoma: sheets of large epithelioid to spindle cells with vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Both cases revealed nuclear expression of brachyury, loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression and lack of embryonal, neuroectodermal, or epithelial component. One case showed heterozygous loss of EWSR1 gene by break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization that reflected loss of SMARCB1/INI1 gene. Based on the clival location and histologic findings along with the loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression and positivity for nuclear brachyury staining, the final pathologic diagnosis for both cases was PD chordoma.",

A 36-year-old man presented with a non-enhanced calcified abnormal lesion on the right frontal lobe. The patient underwent subtotal surgical resection, PAV chemotherapy (procarbazine, nimustine (ACNU) and vincristine), and fractionated radiotherapy with 50 Gy. The pathological diagnosis was oligodendroglioma, IDH mutant and 1p/19q codeleted, World Health Organization 2016 grade II. Six years later, a new enhanced lesion appeared, and the recurrent tumor was surgically removed. Although the histopathological findings indicated gliosarcoma, the recurrent tumor still demonstrated the IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeleted. Thus, the recurrent tumor was considered to originate from oligodendroglioma, rather than being newly generated after chemoradiotherapy. Interestingly, the second recurrent tumor responded well to temozolomide chemotherapy. Based on the findings of this case, oligodendrogliomas have the potential for mesenchymal transformation on progression, while keeping their genotype.",

If not previously used, modern androgen signaling inhibitors have established clinical activity in this setting. Cabazitaxel and radium-223 have also been shown to extend survival in appropriately selected patients. Carboplatin-containing chemotherapy regimens have not been studied in randomized trials with a survival endpoint, but they have demonstrated activity in phase II trials and are occasionally considered in the post-docetaxel setting. Recent identification of potentially exploitable targets in the molecular makeup of advanced prostate cancer has created opportunities for clinical trials of novel targeted agents, with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors yielding compelling early results in molecularly selected patients. Much remains to be done to improve the lot of patients with docetaxel-unresponsive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.",

Here we review the clinical data supporting these different plasma genotyping methodologies, and present a practical approach to the interpretation of the results of these tests. While the clinical application of plasma genotyping has been most extensively validated in the metastatic setting-for the detection of targetable alterations at the time of initial diagnosis or disease progression-this technology holds significant promise across many tumor types and stages of disease. We will also review emerging applications of plasma genotyping that are currently under clinical investigation.",

Until recently, therapeutic strategies consisted primarily of local treatments, including surgery, whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Surgery, WBRT, and SRS-alone and in various combinations-still play an important role in treatment, especially in patients with few and/or smaller brain lesions.

The aim of this study is to determine the expression profile of MXR7 in HCC and investigate the influence of MXR7 on invasion and metastasis of HCC cells. For this purpose, immunohistochemical assay was used to identify the differential expression of MXR7 in 94 HCC specimens. Expression of MXR7 in 4 pairs of HCC and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) was also tested. The motility of HCC cells were characterized by transwell migration and matrigel invasion assays. In vivo metastasis potential was determined via tail vein injection assay. Moreover, compared with noninvasive HCC tumors or human HCC cell lines with low metastatic potential, invasive HCC samples and HCC cell lines with high metastatic potential exhibited higher MXR7 expression. Furthermore, forced expression of MXR7 in SMMC-7721 promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and accelerated tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Conversely, knockdown of MXR7 expression in HuH7 cells inhibited proliferation and motility of cells. Mechanically, overexpression of MXR7 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress, and MXR7 depletion repressed the EMT phenotype. In conclusion, MXR7 is a mediator of EMT and metastasis in HCC and may serve as a novel therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "With 23 and 47% higher colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality, respectively, among African Americans vs. Whites, CRC screening studies are important. Screening guidelines recommend 5-yearly colonoscopy screening of persons with a family history of CRC (first-degree relatives, FDRs), beginning at 40 years of age. For this elevated-risk group, colonoscopy screening is preferred because of the risk of more aggressive cancer that may elude early detection by other methods. African Americans with a family history of CRC are at the intersection of two elevated risk demographics, race and FDR status. This study explored racial disparities in colonoscopy screening of FDRs using 2005, 2010, and 2015 national survey data on 3220 Whites and 466 African Americans.Despite increasing colonoscopy rates among FDRs (72.3 and 62.2% in 2015 among Whites and African Americans, respectively), the 40-49 age group showed substantial racial disparities each year, persisting through 2015 (58.8, 31.7, and 35.3% lower among African Americans in 2005, 2010, and 2015, respectively). Adjusted analysis of the pooled 3-year sample showed that FDRs aged 40-49 years had one-third the colonoscopy likelihood of the 50-plus age group. African Americans without college education were 40 and 60% less likely than Whites without college and with college education, respectively, to have had a colonoscopy. The sustained, high screening disparity, and low colonoscopy rates in the 40-49 age group overall, call for novel approaches to reduce CRC mortality disparities, such as, patient navigation programs to reach out to younger FDRs, particularly, less educated African Americans.",

Thus, information about AuNP potential toxicity and effects on human health is necessary for the use of nanomaterials in clinical settings. The aim of our research is to examine the effects of AuNPs on the epithelial origin cell lines: continuous and oncogenic. Embryonic porcine kidney epithelial inoculated (SPEV) cell line and colorectal carcinoma cell line (HT29) were used. In the test cultures, the cell proliferation, necrosis/apoptosis, and multicellular spheroids generation were evaluated. We demonstrated that AuNP concentrations of 6-12 μg/ml reduced the proliferation of SPEV and HT29 cells and increased the cell number at early and late stages of apoptosis and necrosis. It was shown that small concentrations of AuNPs (1-3 μg/ml) stimulate multicellular spheroid formation by HT29 and SPEV cells. However, higher AuNP concentrations (6-12 μg/ml) had both cytotoxic and anti-cohesive effects on cell in suspension. The large sensitiveness to the action of AuNPs was shown by the line of HT29 (6 μg/ml) as compared to the SPEV cells (12 μg/ml). This experimental study of the effect of AuNPs on SPEV and HT29 cell lines will justify their further application in AuNP-mediated anticancer treatment.",

In this investigation, doxorubicin (Dox) was assembled to a folic acid-modified DNA tetra via click chemistry to prepare a targeted antitumor agent. Cellular uptake efficiency was measured via fluorescent imaging. Cytotoxicity, inhibition efficiency, and corresponding mechanism on colon cancer cell line HT-29 were evaluated by MTT assay, cell proliferation curve, western blot, and flow cytometry. No cytotoxicity was induced by DNA tetra, but the cellular uptake ratio increased obviously resulting from the DNA tetra-facilitated penetration through cellular membrane. Accordingly, folic acid-DNA tetra-Dox markedly increased the antitumor efficiency with increased apoptosis levels. In details, 100 μM was the effective concentration and a 6-h incubation period was needed for apoptosis induction. In conclusion, nano-sized DNA tetrahedron was a safe and effective delivery system for Dox and correspondingly enhanced the anticancer efficiency.",

Ten postoperative adverse events were detected in nine patients (44.4%). 28% were grade I-II and 17% were grade III-IV. Disease-free survival at 1 and 3 years was 67 and 44%, respectively. Overall survival at 1 and 3 years was 100 and 88%, respectively. Only cytoreduction was related to worst disease free survival after univariate (p = 0.007) and multivariate (OR 11.639, 95% CI 1.24-109.74, p = 0.03) analyses. Cytoreduction was related to the worst overall survival after univariate analysis (p = 0.046).CONCLUSION: Cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC for pseudomyxoma peritonei and appendix tumours in elderly patients it is a procedure with feasible postoperative morbi-mortality and survival outcomes.TRIAL REGISTRATION: researchregistry1587 (retrospectively registered).",

    "abstract": "Hypermethylation in the CpG island promoter regions of tumor suppressors is known to play a significant role in the development of HNSCC and the detection of which can aid the classification and prognosis of HNSCC. This study aims to profile the methylation patterns in a panel of key genes including CDKN2A, CDKN2B, KLOTHO (KL), RASSF1A, RARB, SLIT2, and SFRP1, in a group of HNSCC samples from Saudi Arabia. The extent of methylation in these genes is determined using the MethyLight assay and correlated with known clinicopathological parameters in our samples of 156 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded HNSCC tissues. SLIT2 methylation had the highest frequency (64.6%), followed by RASSF1A (41.3%), RARB (40.7%), SFRP1 (34.9), KL (30.7%), CKDN2B (29.6%), and CKDN2A (29.1%). KL and SFRP1 methylation were more predominant in nasopharyngeal tumors (P = 0.001 and P = 0.031 respectively). Kaplan Meier analysis showed that patients with moderately differentiated tumors who display SFRP1 methylation have significantly worse overall survival in comparison with other samples. In contrast, better clinical outcomes were seen in patients with KL methylation. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the detection of frequent methylation in SFRP1 and KL genes' promoters could serve as prognostic biomarkers for HNSCC.",

Compared to HPV-negative HNC, HPV-positive OPC exhibits significantly better prognosis and an enhanced response to treatment. Recognition of the survival benefit of HPV-positive tumors has led to therapeutic de-intensification strategies aiming to mitigate treatment-related toxicities while maintaining high response rates. In this review, we summarize key aspects of oral HPV infection and the molecular mechanisms of HPV-related carcinogenesis. We review the clinical and molecular characteristics of HPV-positive OPC that contribute to its improved prognosis compared to HPV-negative HNC. We also discuss current and emerging treatment strategies, emphasizing potential mechanisms of treatment sensitivity and the role of therapeutic de-intensification in HPV-positive OPC. Lastly, we examine literature on the management and prognosis of recurrent/metastatic HPV-positive OPC with a focus on the role of salvage surgery in its management.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Resection of tumors close to the corticospinal tract (CST) carries a high risk of damage to the CST. For cystic tumors, aspirating the cyst before resection may reduce the risk of damage to vital structures. This study evaluated the effectiveness of cyst aspiration, by comparing the results before and after aspiration of diffusion tensor image (DTI) tractography.METHODS: This study enrolled 23 patients with large cystic brain tumors (>20 cm(3)) between 2012 and 2016. All underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including DTI tractography, followed by navigation-guided aspiration of the cyst and subsequent tumor resection via craniotomy. Distances between the tumor margin and CST before and after cyst aspiration, volume reduction, and postoperative outcomes were assessed.RESULTS: Median tumor volume decreased from 88 cm(3) (range, 25-153) to 29 cm(3) (range, 20-80) and distances between tumor margins and the CST increased from 5.7 mm (range, 0.6-22.0) to 14.8 mm (range, 0.6-41.4) after aspiration. Neurological symptoms of patients immediately improved after cyst aspiration. All patients, except for one with a secondary glioblastoma, underwent gross total resection of the tumor. No neurological deterioration was observed after tumor resection.CONCLUSIONS: Navigation-guided cyst aspiration followed by resection is a useful and safe procedure for brain tumors with large cystic components. Cyst aspiration resulted in expansion of the compressed brain tissue between the tumor margins and vital structures, making maximal safe resection possible.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ascites increases perioperative complications and risk of death, but is not an absolute contraindication for colectomy in patients with colon cancer. It remains unclear whether postoperative risks can be minimized using a laparoscopic versus open approach.METHODS: Data were retrospectively analyzed from 2152 patients with ascites who underwent laparoscopic or open partial colectomy with diagnosis of colon cancer from 2005 to 2013 using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Postoperative outcomes were analyzed using two-sample tests of proportions and two-sample T tests. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) or β coefficients for postoperative complications, hospital length of stay, and 30-day mortality were calculated using multivariable logistic or linear regression. P values <0.05 two-tailed were considered statistically significant.RESULTS: 205 patients (9.53%) with ascites underwent laparoscopic colectomy (LC). There was no significant difference in operative time between laparoscopic versus open surgery (145 vs. 146 min, P = 0.69). LC was associated with decreased likelihood of overall complications (adjusted OR 0.7 95% CI 0.4-1.0, P = 0.046) and shorter hospital length of stay (9 days vs. 15 days, adjusted β = -4.2, 95% CI -7.7 to -0.7, P = 0.018). There was no difference in 30-day mortality (adjusted OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.50-1.35, P = 0.429).CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic colectomy decreases postoperative complications and hospital length of stay in patients with colon cancer and ascites. Laparoscopic approach should be considered for patients in this high-risk population.",

    "abstract": "The reported treatment outcomes of children treated for cancer in Eastern European countries are inferior to those in Northern/Western Europe. We hypothesized that recent survival rates could be comparable to the current standards and performed a population-based analysis of treatment outcome of childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in Lithuania, a small Eastern European country. Children < 18 years old who were treated for AML from 2000 to 2013 were included (n = 54). Estimates of 5-year event-free (EFS5y) and overall survival (OS5y) rates were analyzed. Comparing periods 2000-2006 (n = 32) and 2007-2013 (n = 22), the EFS5y improved from 31 to 63% (p = 0.04), and the OS5y improved from 31 to 72% (p = 0.02) because of reductions in toxicity-related mortality (42 vs. 15%, p = 0.08) and relapse (43 vs. 25%, p = 0.08). The most significant improvement was demonstrated in high-risk patients (OS5y improved from 26 to 75%, p = 0.02) who benefited from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: the post-transplant EFS5y increased from 13 to 86% (p = 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: The current survival rate of Lithuanian children treated for AML was comparable to the expected rate in other parts of Europe. What is Known: • In the last three decades, significant improvement has been achieved in treating childhood cancer, with an overall survival (OS) rate of > 80% in high-income countries. The difference in survival rates between Northern/Western and Eastern European countries as well as between high- and middle-/low-income countries is as much as 20%. Recently, the 5-year event-free survival rate of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has reached > 60% in high-income countries. The survival rates for myeloproliferative diseases were the lowest in Eastern European countries. • The reported inferior survival rates were calculated based on outcome data of patients treated until 2007. The recent survival rates in Eastern European countries are unknown. What is New: • Being a small Eastern European country, Lithuania has experienced good economic growth during the last decade. We hypothesized that economic growth and gain of experience could result in better survival rates of children treated for cancer in our country in recent years. • A population-based analysis of treatment outcome of childhood AML treated in Lithuania in the recent years was performed for the first time. The survival rates of childhood AML in Lithuania are comparable to those of other high-income countries. Current survival rates of children treated for cancer in Eastern European countries could be comparable to the best current standards contributing to better European survival rates of childhood cancer in general.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the non-inferiority of synthetic image (SI) mammography versus full-field digital mammography (FFDM) in breast tomosynthesis (DBT) examinations.METHODS: An observational, retrospective, single-centre, multireader blinded study was performed, using 2384 images to directly compare SI and FFDM based on Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) categorisation and visibility of radiological findings. Readers had no access to digital breast tomosynthesis slices. Multiple reader, multiple case (MRMC) receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology was used to compare the diagnostic performance of SI and FFDM images. The kappa statistic was used to estimate the inter-reader and intra-reader reliability.RESULTS: The area under the ROC curves (AUC) reveals the non-inferiority of SI versus FFDM based on BIRADS categorisation [difference between AUC (ΔAUC), -0.014] and lesion visibility (ΔAUC, -0.001) but the differences were not statistically significant (p=0.282 for BIRADS; p=0.961 for lesion visibility). On average, 77.4% of malignant lesions were detected with SI versus 76.5% with FFDM. Sensitivity and specificity of SI are superior to FFDM for malignant lesions scored as BIRADS 5 and breasts categorised as BIRADS 1.CONCLUSIONS: SI is not inferior to FFDM when DBT slices are not available during image reading. SI can replace FFDM, reducing the dose by 45%.KEY POINTS: • Stand-alone SI demonstrated performance not inferior for lesion visibility as compared to FFDM. • Stand-alone SI demonstrated performance not inferior for lesion BIRADS categorisation as compared to FFDM. • Synthetic images provide important dose savings in breast tomosynthesis examinations.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although cold polypectomy techniques are preferred over polypectomy with electrocautery in the management of diminutive polyps, comprehensive comparisons among various cold polypectomy techniques have not yet been fully performed.METHODS: We searched for all relevant randomized controlled trials published up until October 2016 examining the efficacy of cold polypectomy techniques for diminutive polyps. Cold polypectomy techniques were classified as cold forceps polypectomy (CFP), jumbo forceps polypectomy (JFP), traditional cold snare polypectomy (CSP), and dedicated CSP, according to the type of device. A network meta-analysis was performed to calculate the direct and indirect estimates of efficacy among the cold polypectomy techniques.RESULTS: Seven studies with 703 patients and 968 polyps were included in the meta-analysis. Regarding comparative efficacy for complete histological eradication, there was no inconsistency in the network (Cochran's Q test, df = 4, P = 0.22; I (2) = 30%). In terms of complete histological eradication, both dedicated and traditional CSP were superior to CFP (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval [CI]] 4.31 [1.92-9.66] and 2.45 [1.30-4.63], respectively); dedicated CSP was superior to traditional CSP (OR [95% CI] 1.76 [1.07-2.89]); and there was no difference between JFP versus CFP (OR [95% CI] 1.36 [0.40-4.61]). Regarding tissue retrieval rate, there was no difference between dedicated versus traditional CSP (OR [95% CI] 1.03 [0.44-2.38]). The procedure time for CSP was comparable to that of CFP.CONCLUSIONS: Dedicated CSP was shown to be superior to other cold polypectomy techniques in terms of complete histological eradication. Cold polypectomy using a dedicated snare can be recommended for the removal of diminutive colorectal polyps.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammatory response in spinal dorsal horn has been demonstrated to be a critical factor in oxaliplatin-induced pain. Melatonin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-allodynia effects in both preclinical and clinical studies. In the present study, we investigated the role of systemic administration of melatonin on oxaliplatin-induced pain. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with oxaliplatin induced significantly mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Melatonin (i.p.) significantly alleviated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in the oxaliplatin but not sham-treated rats. The attenuation of nociceptive response persisted at least to 3 days after melatonin injection, throughout the entire observing window. Immunohistochemistry showed that oxaliplatin induced a significant increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunodensities, which could be suppressed by melatonin. Western blotting showed that GFAP protein levels were significantly elevated in the oxaliplatin-vehicle group. Melatonin significantly decreased oxaliplatin-induced upregulation of GFAP expressions. Oxaliplatin injection also enhanced the messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of cytokines including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and chemokines including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and monocyte inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1α) in the spinal dorsal horn, which could be significantly repressed by melatonin. In vitro study showed that mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, MCP-1, and MIP-1α in primarily astrocytes were significantly increased after lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 μg/ml) stimulation. Melatonin (10 and 100 μM) greatly inhibited synthesis of these inflammatory mediators, in a dose-related manner. Conclusively, our data provide a novel implication of anti-nociceptive mechanism of melatonin in chemotherapy-related pain.",

    "abstract": "Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) is a tissue graft of allogeneic origin from post-mortem tissue donors prepared by an innovative decellularization process. The newly developed non-toxic and low cost decellularization process of cadaver origin dermis included ADM in breast reconstruction procedures proved to help coverage of the lower-pole of breast expanders or implants. As the results have shown, it did help to eliminate autologous dermis donor site morbidity along with shortening the operation time by avoiding elevation of additional muscle or fascia during the operation. Main aims of this article include histology evaluation of allogeneic acellular dermal matrix prepared by a new decellularization method and presentation of clinical results of its use. A total of 22 patients underwent 26 ADM based breast reconstructions. The mean patient's follow up was 12.6 months. Average total size of ADM used for one breast was 273 cm(2). Post-operative complications occurred in 3 patients including one expander infection, one expander extrusion and one expander pocket disfiguration. Microscopic analysis of tissue samples has confirmed incorporation of the acellular dermal matrices into the surrounding connective tissue without any noticeable immune reaction. In a majority of the ADM samples we found pseudocapsullar formation on implant side of samples without acute or chronic inflammatory cells. The use of ADM prepared by new preparation method in expansive post mastectomy breast reconstruction was associated by a relatively low complication rate resulting in good outcomes.",

A prospectively randomized study in 181 patients with SH was carried out over a period of 24 months. One hundred and ninety-three patients were seen. One hundred and eighty-one patients with SH were enrolled, of which 165 completed final follow-up. One hundred and nineteen patients received PDL alone and 46 received 5-ALA PDL. The patients were assessed clinically and the patient's parents were given a satisfaction questionnaire. Baseline patient data (gender, lesion size, lesion site, treatment times, cure rate, and adverse reactions) were recorded and the results of the treatment of the two groups were analyzed and compared. Complete clearing of the lesion (recovery grade 4) was achieved in 44/119 (37.0%) of the PDL alone group and 31/46 (67.4%) of the 5-ALA PDL group (X (2) = 10.30, p < 0.001). Atrophic scars, hyper- and hypopigmentation occurred in both groups (X (2) = 3.32, p = 0.564). The patients' parents' satisfaction was greater in the 5-ALA PDL group. The clinical outcome of 5-ALA PDL was superior to that of PDL alone in the treatment of SH and only minor adverse events occurred in each group.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The fundamentals of endoscopic surgery (FES) examination is a national test of knowledge and skill in flexible gastrointestinal endoscopy. The skill portion of the examination involves five tasks that assesses the following skills: scope navigation, loop reduction, mucosal inspection, retroflexion, and targeting. This project aimed to assess the efficacy of a proficiency-based virtual reality (VR) curriculum in preparing residents for the FES skills exam.METHODS: Experienced (>100 career colonoscopies) and inexperienced endoscopists (<50 career colonoscopies) were recruited to participate. Six VR modules were identified as reflecting the skills tested in the exam. All participants were asked to perform each of the selected modules twice, and median performance was compared between the two groups. Inexperienced endoscopists were subsequently randomized in matched pairs into a repetition (10 repetitions of each task) or proficiency curriculum. After completion of the respective curriculum, FES scores and pass rates were compared to national data and historical institutional control data (endoscopy-rotation training alone).RESULTS: Five experienced endoscopists and twenty-three inexperienced endoscopists participated. Construct valid metrics were identified for six modules and proficiency benchmarks were set at the median performance of experienced endoscopists. FES scores of inexperienced endoscopists in the proficiency group had significantly higher FES scores (530 ± 86) versus historical control (386.7 ± 92.2, p = 0.0003) and higher pass rate (proficiency: 100%, historical control 61.5%, p = 0.01).CONCLUSION: Trainee engagement in a VR curriculum yields superior FES performance compared to an endoscopy rotation alone. Compared to the 2012-2016 national resident pass rate of 80, 100% of trainees in a proficiency-based curriculum passed the FES manual skills examination.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic complete mesocoloic excision (CME) with central vascular ligation for splenic flexure cancer is technically challenging because of its anatomical complexity. Although embryological and anatomical consideration should be helpful to perform CME in colorectal cancer surgery, such studies on the splenic flexure are lacking.METHODS: The splenic flexure is located embryologically between the terminal portion of the midgut and the beginning of the hindgut, and is supplied by the superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries. The mesentery of the transverse and descending colon originally is a continuous sheet, although they rotate and partially fuse to each other during development. Our surgical strategy was excision of the transverse and descending mesocolon with ligation of the left colic artery and left branch of the middle colic artery, and extraction of the specimen in an intact package wrapped by the embryological planes.RESULTS: We performed laparoscopic surgery according to our surgical strategy in 17 patients with splenic flexure colon cancer. There were no conversions to open surgery or serious intraoperative complications. Two patients had pathological stage (pStage) I, 5 pStage II, 9 pStage III, and 1 pStage IV disease. No patient had recurrence except for 1 with pStage IV cancer, with a median follow-up of 16 months.CONCLUSIONS: Our laparoscopic CME technique is feasible for treatment of splenic flexure cancer. Knowledge of anatomy based on embryology is essential to perform this surgery.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Most submucosal tumors (SMTs) in the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) are irregularly shaped and different from those in the esophagus, where submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection (STER) has been proven effective and safe. However, few reports paid attention to STER for SMTs in the EGJ. The aim of the study was not only to evaluate the effect of STER in patients with SMTs in the EGJ but to analyze the risk factors for failure of en bloc resection.METHODS: A consecutive of 47 patients with SMTs originating from the muscularis propria (MP) layer in the EGJ underwent STER were retrospectively included between September 2012 and December 2016. Thirty-five tumors underwent en bloc resection, and the other 12 tumors received piecemeal resection. The tumor size, operation time, en bloc resection rate, complications, residual, and local recurrence were achieved and compared between the two groups.RESULTS: Forty-six of 47 lesions (97.9%) were successfully resected. The mean lesion size was 29.7 ± 16.3 mm. Both the en bloc resection rate and complete resection rate were 74.5% (35/47). No severe complications occurred in the 47 patients. Patients in the piecemeal resection group had more irregularly shaped lesions, longer tumor diameter, larger tumor size (≥40 mm), longer operation time, and longer hospital stay after procedure (P < 0.05), and there were no statistically differences between the two groups in in-operative complications, post-operative complications, and residual rate (P > 0.05). By univariate analysis and stepwise logistic regression analysis, irregular shape and tumor diameter ≥20 mm were two risk factors for failure of en bloc resection.CONCLUSIONS: STER is an effective and safe technique for the treatment of SMTs arising from the MP layer in the EGJ. Irregular shape and tumor diameter ≥20 mm are the reliable risk factors for en bloc resection failure.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Augmented Reality (AR) guidance is a technology that allows a surgeon to see sub-surface structures, by overlaying pre-operative imaging data on a live laparoscopic video. Our objectives were to evaluate a state-of-the-art AR guidance system in a tumor surgical resection model, comparing the accuracy of the resection with and without the system. Our system has three phases. Phase 1: using the MRI images, the kidney's and pseudotumor's surfaces are segmented to construct a 3D model. Phase 2: the intra-operative 3D model of the kidney is computed. Phase 3: the pre-operative and intra-operative models are registered, and the laparoscopic view is augmented with the pre-operative data.METHODS: We performed a prospective experimental study on ex vivo porcine kidneys. Alginate was injected into the parenchyma to create pseudotumors measuring 4-10 mm. The kidneys were then analyzed by MRI. Next, the kidneys were placed into pelvictrainers, and the pseudotumors were laparoscopically resected. The AR guidance system allows the surgeon to see tumors and margins using classical laparoscopic instruments, and a classical screen. The resection margins were measured microscopically to evaluate the accuracy of resection.RESULTS: Ninety tumors were segmented: 28 were used to optimize the AR software, and 62 were used to randomly compare surgical resection: 29 tumors were resected using AR and 33 without AR. The analysis of our pathological results showed 4 failures (tumor with positive margins) (13.8%) in the AR group, and 10 (30.3%) in the Non-AR group. There was no complete miss in the AR group, while there were 4 complete misses in the non-AR group. In total, 14 (42.4%) tumors were completely missed or had a positive margin in the non-AR group.CONCLUSIONS: Our AR system enhances the accuracy of surgical resection, particularly for small tumors. Crucial information such as resection margins and vascularization could also be displayed.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endoscopy remains a critical component of General Surgery and Gastroenterology training. Whilst residents need to gain experience, the quality of endoscopy which patients receive cannot be compromised. We conducted this study to compare quality indicators between consultants and residents with regards to colonoscopy.METHODS: A review of colonoscopies from a prospectively collected database was performed from September 2011 to February 2016. Quality indicators such as caecum intubation rate, adenoma detection rate, adherence to a 6-min withdrawal rule, mean number of polyps detected per colonoscope, and complications were collected and compared between the two groups.RESULTS: In total, out of 25,749 colonoscopies that were performed, 14,168 (55.0%) were performed by Consultants. Consultants achieved a better caecum intubation rate compared with residents (96.0% vs 94.9%, p < 0.001), and were more compliant to the 6-min withdrawal rule (74.7% vs 68.6%, p < 0.001). There were, however, no statistically significant differences in the adenoma detection rate (33.5% vs 34.5%, p = 0.098). Bleeding was a rare complication that was encountered more frequently in colonoscopies performed by consultants than for residents (0.002% vs 0.00008%, p < 0.001). There were only three (%) perforations in the entire series, and all were from colonoscopies performed by Consultants.CONCLUSION: Given the proper training, residents are able to perform colonoscopy with the same level of competence as consultants. Whilst colonoscopic related complications are often tied to the difficulty of the procedures, the adherence to the 6-min withdrawal rule must be reinforced and continually educated to both residents and consultants.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) is an endoscopic operating platform for local excision of rectal neoplasms. However, it may be technically demanding, and its learning curve has yet to be adequately defined. The objective of this study was to determine the number of TAMIS procedures for the local excision of rectal neoplasm required to reach proficiency.METHODS AND PROCEDURES: All TAMIS cases performed from 07/2009 to 12/2016 at a single high-volume tertiary care institution for local excision of benign and malignant rectal neoplasia were identified from a prospective database. A cumulative summation (CUSUM) analysis was performed to determine the number of cases required to reach proficiency. The main proficiency outcome was rate of margin positivity (R1 resection). The acceptable and unacceptable R1 rates were defined as the R1 rate of transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM-10%) and traditional transanal excision (TAE-26%), which was obtained from previously published meta-analyses. Comparisons of patient, tumor, and operative characteristics before and after TAMIS proficiency were performed.RESULTS: A total of 254 TAMIS procedures were included in this study. The overall R1 resection rate was 7%. The indication for TAMIS was malignancy in 57%. CUSUM analysis reported that TAMIS reached an acceptable R1 rate between 14 and 24 cases. Moving average plots also showed that the mean operative times stabilized by proficiency gain. The mean lesion size was larger after proficiency gain (3.0 cm (SD 1.5) vs. 2.3 cm (SD 1.3), p = 0.008). All other patient, tumor, and operative characteristics were similar before and after proficiency gain.CONCLUSIONS: TAMIS for local excision of rectal neoplasms is a complex procedure that requires a minimum of 14-24 cases to reach an acceptable R1 resection rate and lower operative duration.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In a tertiary center setting we aimed to study the diagnostic accuracy and clinical impact of EUS-guided biopsy sampling (EUS-FNB) with a reverse bevel needle compared with that of fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in the work-up of subepithelial lesions (SEL).METHODS: All patients presenting with SELs referred for EUS-guided sampling were prospectively included in 2012-2015. After randomization of the first pass modality, dual sampling with both EUS-FNB and EUS-FNA was performed in each lesion. Outcome measures in an intention-to-diagnose analysis were the diagnostic accuracy, technical failures, and adverse events. The clinical impact was measured as the performance of additional diagnostic procedures post-EUS and the rate of unwarranted resections compared with a reference cohort of SELs sampled in the same institution 2006-2011.RESULTS: In 70 dual sampling procedures of unique lesions (size: 6-220 mm) the diagnostic sensitivity for malignancy and the overall accuracy of EUS-FNB was superior to EUS-FNA compared head-to-head (90 vs 52%, and 83 vs 49%, both p < 0.001). The adverse event rate of EUS-FNB was low (1.2%). EUS-FNB in 2012-2015 had a positive clinical impact in comparison with the reference cohort demonstrated by less cases referred for an additional diagnostic procedure, 12/83 (14%) vs 39/73 (53%), p < 0.001, and fewer unwarranted resections in cases subjected to surgery, 3/48 (6%) vs 12/35 (34%), p = 0.001.CONCLUSIONS: EUS-FNB with a reverse bevel needle is safe and superior to EUS-FNA in providing a conclusive diagnosis of subepithelial lesions. This biopsy sampling approach facilitates a rational clinical management and accurate treatment.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine the diagnostic performance of FDG-PET/MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (FDG-PET/DWIMRI) for detection and local staging of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) after radio(chemo)therapy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study that included 74 consecutive patients with previous radio(chemo)therapy for HNSCC and in whom tumour recurrence or radiation-induced complications were suspected clinically. The patients underwent hybrid PET/MRI examinations with morphological MRI, DWI and FDG-PET. Experienced readers blinded to clinical/histopathological data evaluated images according to established diagnostic criteria taking into account the complementarity of multiparametric information. The standard of reference was histopathology with whole-organ sections and follow-up ≥24 months. Statistical analysis considered data clustering.RESULTS: The proof of diagnosis was histology in 46/74 (62.2%) patients and follow-up (mean ± SD = 34 ± 8 months) in 28/74 (37.8%). Thirty-eight patients had 43 HNSCCs and 46 patients (10 with and 36 without tumours) had 62 benign lesions/complications. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of PET/DWIMRI were 97.4%, 91.7%, 92.5% and 97.1% per patient, and 93.0%, 93.5%, 90.9%, and 95.1% per lesion, respectively. Agreement between imaging-based and pathological T-stage was excellent (kappa = 0.84, p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: FDG-PET/DWIMRI yields excellent results for detection and T-classification of HNSCC after radio(chemo)therapy.KEY POINTS: • FDG-PET/DWIMRI yields excellent results for the detection of post-radio(chemo)therapy HNSCC recurrence. • Prospective one-centre study showed excellent agreement between imaging-based and pathological T-stage. • 97.5% of positive concordant MRI, DWI and FDG-PET results correspond to recurrence. • 87% of discordant MRI, DWI and FDG-PET results correspond to benign lesions. • Multiparametric FDG-PET/DWIMRI facilitates planning of salvage surgery in the irradiated neck.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adenoma detection rate (ADR) is a quality indicator for screening colonoscopy, but its calculation is time-consuming. Polyp detection rate (PDR) has been found to correlate with ADR; however, its use as a quality indicator has been criticized out of concern for endoscopists artificially inflating the PDR. We aim to evaluate whether active monitoring affects PDR.METHODS: In March 2015, 14 endoscopists were made aware that their personal PDRs would be tracked monthly as a quality improvement project. Endoscopists received a report of their individual monthly and cumulative PDR, departmental averages, and a benchmark PDR. Following the intervention, data were collected for consecutive patients undergoing average risk screening colonoscopy for six months. PDR, ADR, and adenoma to polyp detection ratio quotient (APDRQ) were compared to a six-month pre-intervention period.RESULTS: 2203 patients were included in the study. There was no statistically significant difference in PDR when comparing pre- and post-intervention (44 vs. 45%, OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.77-1.36). No statistically significant difference in ADR was observed when comparing pre- and post-intervention (29 vs. 30%, OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.64-1.52). There was no statistically significant difference in APDRQ when comparing pre- and post-intervention (0.67 vs. 0.66, OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.69-1.33).CONCLUSIONS: Monthly report cards did not result in a change in PDR or APDRQ. In some environments, PDR can be used as a surrogate marker of ADR, despite endoscopist awareness that PDR is being measured.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess safety/efficacy of yttrium-90 radioembolization (Y90) in patients with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following curative surgical resection.METHODS: With IRB approval, we searched our prospectively acquired database for patients that were treated with Y90 for recurrent disease following resection. Baseline characteristics and bilirubin toxicities following Y90 were evaluated. Intention-to-treat overall survival (OS) and time-to-progression (TTP) from Y90 were assessed.RESULTS: Forty-one patients met study inclusion criteria. Twenty-six (63%) patients had undergone minor (≤3 hepatic segments) resection while 15 (37%) patients underwent major (>3 hepatic segments) resections. Two patients (5%) had biliary-enteric anastomoses created during surgical resection. The median time from HCC resection to the first radioembolization was 17 months (95% CI: 13-37). The median number of Y90 treatment sessions was 1 (range: 1-5). Ten patients received (entire remnant) lobar Y90 treatment while 31 patients received selective (≤2 hepatic segments) treatment. Grades 1/2/3/4 bilirubin toxicity were seen in nine (22%), four (10%), four (10%), and zero (0%) patients following Y90. No differences in bilirubin toxicities were identified when comparing lobar with selective approaches (P = 0.20). No post-Y90 infectious complications were identified. Median TTP and OS were 11.3 (CI: 6.5-15.5) and 22.1 months (CI: 10.3-31.3), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Radioembolization is a safe and effective method for treating recurrent HCC following surgical resection, with prolonged TTP and promising survival outcomes.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The prognostic value of the tumor-to-liver uptake ratio (TLR) from 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) in the early stage of colorectal cancer (CRC) is unclear. Notably, some stage IIA CRC patients experience early recurrence even after curative resection and might benefit from neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. This study aims to evaluate whether elevated TLR from (18)F-FDG-PET/CT can predict poor prognosis in stage IIA CRC patients undergoing curative resection.METHODS: From April 2010 to December 2013, 504 consecutive CRC patients with different TNM stages (I-IV) underwent (18)F-FDG-PET/CT scans at the 6th Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University. Among the patients, 118 with stage IIA CRC who accepted preoperative (18)F-FDG-PET/CT scanning and were treated with curative surgery alone were reviewed retrospectively. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in the primary tumor, TLR, and demographic, clinical, histopathological, and laboratory data were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors associated with patient disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: ROC curve analysis demonstrated that TLR was superior to primary tumor SUVmax in predicting the risk of recurrence in stage IIA CRC. The optimal TLR cutoff was 6.2. Univariate analysis indicated that elevated TLR, tumor size, and lymphovascular/neural invasion correlated with DFS (P = 0.001, P = 0.002, and P = 0.001, respectively) and OS (P = 0.001, P = 0.003, and P < 0.001, respectively). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year DFS rates were 98.4%, 96.9%, and 96.9% for stage IIA CRC patients with lower TLR (≤6.2) versus 77.8%, 60.6%, and 60.6% for those with elevated TLR (>6.2), respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 100.0%, 100.0%, and 98.3% for the patients with lower TLR versus 98.1%, 83.3%, and 74.3% for those with elevated TLR. Cox regression analysis showed that elevated TLR [>6.2; hazard ratio (HR): 3.109-57.463; P < 0.001] and tumor size (>4.4 cm; HR: 1.636-19.155; P = 0.006) were independent risk factors for DFS. Meanwhile, elevated TLR (>6.2; HR: 1.398-84.945; P = 0.023) and lymphovascular/neural invasion (positive; HR: 1.278-12.777; P = 0.017) were independent risk factors for OS.CONCLUSION: Elevated TLR predicted worse DFS and OS for stage IIA CRC patients and might serve as a potential radiological index to identify candidates for neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Stage IIA CRC patients with elevated TLR should be monitored carefully for early detection of possible recurrence.",

    "abstract": "Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are widely used to identify clinically actionable molecular alterations or perform retrospective molecular studies. Our goal was to quantify degradation of DNA occurring during mid to long-term storage of samples in usual conditions. We selected 46 FFPE samples of surgically resected carcinomas of lung, colon, and urothelial tract, of which DNA had been previously extracted. We performed a second DNA extraction on the same blocks under identical conditions after a median period of storage of 5.5 years. Quantitation of DNA by fluorimetry showed a 53% decrease in DNA quantity after storage. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting KRAS exon 2 showed delayed amplification of DNA extracted after storage in all samples but one. The qPCR/fluorimetry quantification ratio decreased from 56 to 15% after storage (p < 0.001). Overall, remaining proportion of DNA analyzable by qPCR represented only 11% of the amount obtained at first extraction. Maximal length of amplifiable DNA fragments assessed with a multiplex PCR was reduced in DNA extracted from stored tissue, indicating that DNA fragmentation had increased in the paraffin blocks during storage. Next-generation sequencing was performed on 12 samples and showed a mean 3.3-fold decrease in library yield and a mean 4.5-fold increase in the number of single-nucleotide variants detected after storage. In conclusion, we observed significant degradation of DNA extracted from the same FFPE block after 4 to 6 years of storage. Better preservation strategies should be considered for storage of FFPE biopsy specimens.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To measure myocardium iodine concentration (MIC) in patients with cardiac amyloidosis (CA) using dual-energy computed tomography (DECT).METHODS: Twenty-two patients with CA, 13 with non-amyloid hypertrophic cardiomyopathies (CH) and 10 control patients were explored with pre-contrast, arterial and 5-minute DECT acquisition (Iomeprol; 1.5 mL/kg). Inter-ventricular septum (IVS) thickness, blood pool iodine concentration (BPIC), MIC (mg/mL), iodine ratio and extra-cellular volume (ECV) were calculated.RESULTS: IVS thickness was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in CA (17 ± 4 mm) and CH (15 ± 3 mm) patients than in control patients (10 ± 1 mm). CA patients exhibited significantly (p < 0.001) higher 5-minute MIC [2.6 (2.3-3.1) mg/mL], 5-minute iodine ratio (0.88 ± 0.12) and ECV (0.56 ± 0.07) than CH [1.7 (1.4-2.2) mg/mL, 0.57 ± 0.07 and 0.36 ± 0.05, respectively] and control patients [1.9 (1.7-2.4) mg/mL, 0.58 ± 0.07 and 0.35 ± 0.04, respectively). CH and control patients exhibited similar values (p = 0.9). The area under the curve of 5-minute iodine ratio for the differential diagnosis of CA from CH patients was 0.99 (0.73-1.0; p = 0.001). With a threshold of 0.65, the sensitivity and specificity of 5-minute iodine ratio were 100% and 92%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Five-minute MIC and iodine ratio were increased in CA patients and exhibited best diagnosis performance to diagnose CA in comparison to other parameters.KEY POINT: • Dual-energy computed tomography can be used to detect cardiac amyloidosis • Five-minute myocardial iodine concentration and iodine ratio increase in cardiac amyloidosis • Among iodine parameters, 5-minute iodine ratio has the best diagnosis performance.",

Histologic confirmation was available in 87 patients (82%). For mediastinal staging, 92 patients (87%) underwent (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (18-FDG-PET) and/or endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node biopsy or mediastinoscopy. Tumor stage (UICC8, 2017) was IA/B (T1a-c, 1-3 cm) in 86 patients (81%) and IIA (T2a/b, 3-5 cm) in 20 patients (19%). Depending on tumor localization, three different fractionation schedules were used: 3 fractions of 17Gy, 5 fractions of 11Gy, or 8 fractions of 7.5 Gy. Tracking was based on fiducial implants in 13 patients (12%) and on image guidance without markers in 88%.RESULTS: Median follow-up was 15 months (range 0.5-46 months). Acute side effects were mild (fatigue grade 1-2 in 20% and dyspnea grade 1-2 in 17%). Late effects were observed in 4 patients (4%): 3 patients developed pneumonitis requiring therapy (grade 2) and 1 patient suffered a rib fracture (grade 3). In total, 9/106 patients (8%) experienced a local recurrence, actuarial local control rates were 88% (95% confidence interval, CI, 80-96%) at 2 years and 77% (95%CI 56-98%) at 3 years. The median disease-free survival time was 27 months (95%CI 23-31 months). Overall survival was 77% (95%CI 65-85%) at 2 years and 56% (95%CI 39-73%) at 3 years.CONCLUSION: CyberKnife® lung SBRT which allows for real-time tumor tracking and risk-adapted fractionation achieves satisfactory local control and low toxicity rates in inoperable early-stage primary lung cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Surgical treatment of head and neck malignancies frequently includes microvascular free tissue transfer. Preoperative radiotherapy increases postoperative fibrosis-related complications up to transplant loss. Fibrogenesis is associated with re-expression of embryonic preserved tissue developmental mediators: osteopontin (OPN), regulated by sex-determining region Y‑box 9 (Sox9), and homeobox A9 (HoxA9) play important roles in pathologic tissue remodeling and are upregulated in atherosclerotic vascular lesions; dickkopf-1 (DKK1) inhibits pro-fibrotic and atherogenic Wnt signaling. We evaluated the influence of irradiation on expression of these mediators in arteries of the head and neck region.MATERIALS AND METHODS: DKK1, HoxA9, OPN, and Sox9 expression was examined immunohistochemically in 24 irradiated and 24 nonirradiated arteries of the lower head and neck region. The ratio of positive cells to total cell number (labeling index) in the investigated vessel walls was assessed semiquantitatively.RESULTS: DKK1 expression was significantly decreased, whereas HoxA9, OPN, and Sox9 expression were significantly increased in irradiated compared to nonirradiated arterial vessels.CONCLUSION: Preoperative radiotherapy induces re-expression of embryonic preserved mediators in arterial vessels and may thus contribute to enhanced activation of pro-fibrotic downstream signaling leading to media hypertrophy and intima degeneration comparable to fibrotic development steps in atherosclerosis. These histopathological changes may be promoted by HoxA9-, OPN-, and Sox9-related inflammation and vascular remodeling, supported by downregulation of anti-fibrotic DKK1. Future pharmaceutical strategies targeting these vessel alterations, e. g., bisphosphonates, might reduce postoperative complications in free tissue transfer.",

However, atypical response patterns of immunotherapies are not correctly classified using RECIST 1.1 so that the effectiveness is also incorrectly interpreted.METHODICAL INNOVATIONS: In order to correctly interpret these atypical response patterns, special immune-related response criteria in solid tumors (iRECIST) have been published. In contrast to RECIST 1.1 according to iRECIST an initially unconfirmed progressive disease (iUPD) requires confirmation (iCPD) in clinically stable patients by subsequent control imaging after 4-8 weeks. New lesions are separately assessed within iRECIST.PERFORMANCE: The iRECIST procedure allows a standardized objective assessment of a possible pseudo-progression which can occur in up to 10% of cases depending on the immunomodulating drug and tumor entity.ACHIEVEMENTS: In principle, iRECIST was developed only for usage in trials testing modern immunotherapeutics.PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: The iRECIST procedure might also be helpful as an additional objective response criterium for clinical treatment decisions, taking the limitations into account.",

An agarose microwell array was used to generate 3D microtissues with controlled size and shape. The microtissues were exposed to X-ray radiation of various doses, and the radiation damage to cells was examined using a variety of techniques with different end points. Damage to cell membranes and reduction in metabolic activity were examined with the MTT assay and dye inclusion assay. DNA damage was tested with the micronucleus assay, γ-H2AX immunostaining, and HaloChip assay. 3D microtissues exposed to X-rays are smaller compared to unexposed ones in extended cultures, indicating that X-ray radiation can retard the growth of cells in 3D microtissues, where cells at the outer shells of microtissues can prevent further damage to those inside.",

    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) is defined as an endopeptidase in the extracellular matrix (ECM), which plays essential roles in physiological processes such as organogenesis, wound healing, angiogenesis, apoptosis and motility. MMPs are produced and assembled in the cytoplasm as proenzymes with a cytoplasmic domain and require extracellular activation. MMPs can degrade receptors, extracellular matrix proteins, PARPs and release apoptotic substances. MMPs have been found in the cytosol, organelles and extracellular compartments and recently many types of MMPs have been found in the nucleus. However, the mechanisms and roles of MMPs inside the cell nucleus are still poorly understood. Here we summarized the nuclear localization mechanisms of MMPs and their functions in the nucleus such as apoptosis, tissue remodeling upon injury and cancer progression. Most importantly, we found that nuclear MMPs have evolved to translocate to membrane and target ECM possibly through evolution of nuclear localization signal (NLS), natural selection and anti-apoptotic survival. Thus, the knowledge about the evolution and regulation of nuclear MMPs appears to be essential in understanding a variety of cellular processes along with the development of MMP-targeted therapeutic drugs against the progression of certain diseases.",

Among immune-related adverse events caused by nivolumab, interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a clinically serious and potentially life-threatening toxicity, for which appropriate treatment is needed immediately. However, ILD is sometimes difficult to distinguish from invasive lung adenocarcinoma using only computed tomography (CT) findings. A 71-year-old man was diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. The patient developed dyspnoea after eight cycles of nivolumab, when chest CT indicated ILD classified with a cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) pattern. Although immunosuppressive therapies improved the CT findings temporarily, dyspnoea was re-exacerbated 2 months later. The CT findings helped in making the diagnosis of a combination of ILD and invasive lung cancer, confirmed by a transbronchial lung biopsy. In conclusion, nivolumab-related ILD and cancer invasion may concur and aggressive biopsy should be considered if nivolumab-related ILD is refractory to immunosuppressive therapy.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lysine-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1) is a key regulator of the androgen (AR) and estrogen receptors (ER), and LSD1 levels correlate with tumor aggressiveness. Here, we demonstrate that LSD1 regulates vitamin D receptor (VDR) activity and is a mediator of 1,25(OH)2-D3 (vitamin D) action in prostate cancer (PCa).METHODS: Athymic nude mice were xenografted with CWR22 cells and monitored weekly after testosterone pellet removal. Expression of LSD1 and VDR (IHC) were correlated with tumor growth using log-rank test. TRAMP tumors and prostates from wild-type (WT) mice were used to evaluate VDR and LSD1 expression via IHC and western blotting. The presence of VDR and LSD1 in the same transcriptional complex was evaluated via immunoprecipitation (IP) using nuclear cell lysate. The effect of LSD1 and 1,25(OH)2-D3 on cell viability was evaluated in C4-2 and BC1A cells via trypan blue exclusion. The role of LSD1 in VDR-mediated gene transcription was evaluated for Cdkn1a, E2f1, Cyp24a1, and S100g via qRT-PCR-TaqMan and via chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Methylation of Cdkn1a TSS was measured via bisulfite sequencing, and methylation of a panel of cancer-related genes was quantified using methyl arrays. The Cancer Genome Atlas data were retrieved to identify genes whose status correlates with LSD1 and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). Results were correlated with patients' survival data from two separate cohorts of primary and metastatic PCa.RESULTS: LSD1 and VDR protein levels are elevated in PCa tumors and correlate with faster tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. Knockdown of LSD1 reduces PCa cell viability, and gene expression data suggest a dual coregulatory role of LSD1 for VDR, acting as a coactivator and corepressor in a locus-specific manner. LSD1 modulates VDR-dependent transcription by mediating the recruitment of VDR and DNMT1 at the TSS of VDR-targeted genes and modulates the epigenetic status of transcribed genes by altering H3K4me2 and H3K9Ac and DNA methylation. Lastly, LSD1 and DNMT1 belong to a genome-wide signature whose expression correlates with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival in primary and metastatic patients' samples, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate that LSD1 has a dual coregulatory role as corepressor and coactivator for VDR and defines a genomic signature whose targeting might have clinical relevance for PCa patients.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although high risk HPVs are associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer it is not known if they have a causal role. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential role of human papilloma viruses (HPVs) in prostate cancer. The aims are (i) to investigate the presence and confirm the identity of high risk HPVs in benign prostate tissues prior to the development of HPV positive prostate cancer in the same patients, and (ii) to determine if HPVs are biologically active.METHODS: We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify HPVs in specimens from 52 Australian men with benign prostate biopsies who 1 to 10 years later developed prostate cancer. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to assess the expression of HPV E7 oncoproteins, cytokeratin and prostate specific antigen (PSA). We used RNASeq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify possible HPV RNA sequences in prostate cancer.RESULTS: HPV screening using standard PCR was conducted on 28 of the 52 sets of benign and later prostate cancers. HPV L1 genes were identified in 13 (46%) benign and 8 (29%) of 28 later prostate cancers in the same patients. HPV E7 genes were identified in 23 (82%) benign and 19 (68%) of 28 subsequent prostate cancers in the same patients. The same HPV types were present in both the benign and subsequent prostate cancers in 9 sets of specimens. HPV type 16 was identified in 15% of benign and 3% of prostate cancers. HPV type 18 was identified in 26% of benign and 16% of prostate cancers. Small numbers of HPV types 45, 47, 76 and 115 were also identified. High confidence RNA-Seq evidence for high risk HPV types 16 and 18 was identified in 12 (2%) of the 502 TCGA prostate cancer transcriptomes. High risk HPV E7 oncoprotein was positively expressed in 23 (82%) of 28 benign prostate specimens but only in 8 (29%) of 28 of the later prostate cancer specimens. This difference is statistically significant (p = 0.001). Prostate specific antigen (PSA) was more highly expressed in 26 (50%) of 52 prostate cancer specimens as compared to prior benign prostate specimens in the same patients.CONCLUSIONS: High risk HPVs are present in benign prostate tissues prior to the development of HPV positive prostate cancer. There is a significantly higher expression of HPV E7 oncoproteins in benign prostate tissues as compared to late prostate cancer that subsequently developed in the same patients. This observation suggests that HPV oncogenic activity is an early phenomenon in a majority of prostate oncogenesis. TCGA RNA-Seq data suggests that HPV is biologically active in some prostate tumour samples.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Enhancing circulating adiponectin is considered as a potential approach for the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were reported to increase adiponectin by previous studies using a mixture of them. However, their individual effects on adiponectin and the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In the present study, we observed and compared the individual effect of DHA and EPA on adiponectin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and further tested whether DHA or EPA regulated adiponectin by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and its phosphorylation at Ser273 to provide a plausible explanation for their distinct actions.METHODS: Firstly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with different doses of DHA or EPA for 24 h. Secondly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with DHA or EPA in the presence or absence of GW9662. Thirdly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with DHA or EPA for 24 h, followed by being respectively co-incubated with tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) or roscovitine for another 2 h. Bovine serum albumin treatment served as the control. After treatments, cellular and secreted adiponectin, cellular PPARγ and its phosphorylation at Ser273 were determined.RESULTS: Compared with the control, DHA increased cellular and secreted adiponectin at 50 and 100 μmol/L, while EPA increased them at 100 and 200 μmol/L. Adiponectin expressions in DHA treated groups were significantly higher than those in EPA treated groups at 50 and 100 μmol/L. Both DHA and EPA enhanced PPARγ expression, but DHA was more effective. GW9662 blocked DHA- and EPA-induced increases in PPARγ as well as adiponectin. Remarkably, an opposite regulation of PPARγ phosphorylation was detected after fatty acids treatment: DHA inhibited it but EPA stimulated it. TNF-α blocked DHA-induced decrease in PPARγ phosphorylation, which eventually led to a decrease in adiponectin. Roscovitine blocked EPA-induced increase in PPARγ phosphorylation, but the corresponding increase in adiponectin was non-significant.CONCLUSION: DHA compared with EPA led to a greater increase in cellular and secreted adiponectin at relative low concentrations by increasing PPARγ expression and inhibiting its phosphorylation at Ser273. DHA may be more beneficial than EPA in reducing risks of NCDs.",

This study aimed to examine whether acute CF intake can affect exercise-induced changes in antioxidant capacity, oxidative stress, inflammation and NO production, as well as exercise performance and recovery in well-trained cyclists.METHODS: Twelve well-trained male cyclists (mean ± SD age, VO2max: 30 ± 3 years, 63.0 ± 3.5 ml/kg/min) participated in this randomized, double-blind, cross over study. On 2 separate occasions, subjects performed two 30-min time trials 1.5 (TT1) and 3 (TT2) hours after CF (900 mg CF) or placebo (PL, 13 mg CF) intake, interposed by passive rest. Lactate, glucose, heartrate, rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and power output were measured during the TTs. Blood was drawn at baseline, before and after each TT and analyzed for epicatechin serum concentrations, trolox equivalent antioxidative capacity (TEAC), uric acid (UA), malonaldehyde (MDA), L-arginine/ADMA, citrulline, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α plasma concentrations. Relative changes in blood markers and pacing strategy during TT were analysed by repeated measured ANOVA. TT performance was compared between PL and CF by paired t-test.RESULTS: Epicatechin concentrations were increased by CF intake. Exercise-induced increase in TEAC/UA was improved by CF intake (F(1) = 5.57; p = .038) (post-TT1: PL: 113.34 ± 3.9%, CF: 117.64 ± 3.96%, post-TT2: PL: 108.59 ± 3.95%, CF: 123.72 ± 7.4% to baseline), while exercise-induced increases in MDA, IL-1 and IL-6 were not affected by CF intake. TNF-α was unaltered by exercise and by CF. Exercise-induced decreases in L-arginine/ADMA and increases in citrulline were not affected by CF intake. TT1 and TT2 performance and exercise-induced physiological changes were unaffected by CF intake.CONCLUSION: Acute CF intake increased total antioxidant capacity in rest and during exercise, but did not affect exercise-induced lipid peroxidation, inflammation, nor NO production in healthy athletes. Acute CF intake did not improve TT performance and recovery.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN32875, 21-11-2016, retrospectively registered.",

    "abstract": "The pancreas is a complex organ with exocrine and endocrine components. Many pathologies impair exocrine function, including chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Conversely, when the endocrine pancreas fails to secrete sufficient insulin, patients develop diabetes mellitus. Pathology in either the endocrine or exocrine pancreas results in devastating economic and personal consequences. The current standard therapy for treating patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus is daily exogenous insulin injections, but cell sources of insulin provide superior glycaemic regulation and research is now focused on the goal of regenerating or replacing β cells. Stem-cell-based models might be useful to study exocrine pancreatic disorders, and mesenchymal stem cells or secreted factors might delay disease progression. Although the standards that bioengineered cells must meet before being considered as a viable therapy are not yet established, any potential therapy must be acceptably safe and functionally superior to current therapies. Here, we describe progress and challenges in cell-based methods to restore pancreatic function, with a focus on optimizing the site for cell delivery and decreasing requirements for immunosuppression through encapsulation. We also discuss the tools and strategies being used to generate exocrine pancreas and insulin-producing β-cell surrogates in situ and highlight obstacles to clinical application.",

Here we characterise Myst2/Kat7/Hbo1 protein interactions in mouse embryonic stem cells by affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry. This study confirms that in embryonic stem cells Myst2 is part of H3 and H4 histone acetylation complexes similar to those described in somatic cells. We identify a novel Myst2-associated protein, the tumour suppressor protein Niam (Nuclear Interactor of ARF and Mdm2). Human NIAM is involved in chromosome segregation, p53 regulation and cell proliferation in somatic cells, but its role in embryonic stem cells is unknown. We describe the first Niam embryonic stem cell interactome, which includes proteins with roles in DNA replication and repair, transcription, splicing and ribosome biogenesis. Many of Myst2 and Niam binding partners are required for correct embryonic development, implicating Myst2 and Niam in the cooperative regulation of this process and suggesting a novel role for Niam in embryonic biology. The data provides a useful resource for exploring Myst2 and Niam essential cellular functions and should contribute to deeper understanding of organism early development and survival as well as cancer.

We document significant allele-preferential expression of functional variants in CGC genes and across the entire dataset. Notably, we find frequent allele-specific overexpression of variants in tumor-suppressor genes. We also report a list of over-expressed variants from non-CGC genes.

    "abstract": "Some recent studies have suggested that the use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) is associated with cancer development. However, some other studies suggest no such association. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of DPP4i on the risk of developing cancers. The electronic databases PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library and the clinical trial registry were searched for published and unpublished randomized clinical trials on humans. Eligible studies were RCTs conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, comparing DPP4i with a placebo or other active drugs. A total of 72 trials with 35,768 and 33,319 patients enrolled for DPP4i and the comparison drugs, respectively. Overall, no significant associations were detected between the use of DPP4i and cancer development, in comparison with the use of other active drugs or placebo. The results were consistent across pre-defined subgroups stratified by type of DPP4i, type of cancer, drug for comparison, trial duration, or baseline characteristics. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that patients with type 2 diabetes treated with DPP4i do not have a higher risk of developing cancers than patients treated with a placebo or other drugs.",

Indices (0-1) of the roles of ageing (ARD), genetics (GRD) and exogenous (ERD) variables in deaths due to disease were established, and the sum of ARD, GRD and ERD was 1 (value of each indices was <1). Results showed that ageing plays an important role in death from chronic disease; exogenous factors may contribute more to the pattern of chronic disease than genetic factors (ARD, GRC and ERD were 0.818, 0.058 and 0.124 respectively for all non-communicable diseases). In descending order, ERD for non-communicable diseases were breast cancer, leukaemia, cancer of the cervix uteri and uterus, liver cancer, nephritis and nephropathy, stomach cancer, lung cancer, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease, COPD, and Alzheimer's disease, while a smaller ERD indicated a tendency of natural death. An understanding of the aforementioned complex relationships of specific non-communicable diseases will be beneficial in designing primary prevention measures for non-communicable diseases in China.",

    "abstract": "Cell surface binding and internalization are critical for the specific targeting and biofunctions of some cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAPs) with anticancer activities. However, the detailed cellular process for CAPs interacting with cancer cells and the exact molecular basis for their anticancer effects are still far from being fully understood. In the present study, we examined the cell surface binding, uptaking and anti-cancer activity of L-K6, a lysine/leucine-rich CAP, in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We found that L-K6 preferentially interact with MCF-7 cells. This tumor-targeting property of L-K6 might be partially due to its interactions with the surface exposed and negatively charged phosphatidylserine. Subsequently, L-K6 could internalize into MCF-7 cells mainly through a clathrin-independent macropinocytosis, without significant cell surface disruption. Finally, the internalized L-K6 induced a dramatic nuclear damage and MCF-7 cell death, without significant cytoskeleton disruption and mitochondrial impairment. This cytotoxicity of L-K6 against MCF-7 cancer cells could be further confirmed by using a mouse xenograft model. In summary, all these findings outlined the cellular process and cytotoxicity of L-K6 in MCF-7 cancer cells, and might help understand the complicated interactions between CAPs and cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies offer great tools for research. We encountered a potentially useful mouse IgM monoclonal antibody whose antigen is expressed in normal skin but lost in human skin cancer. Because IgM is difficult to work with and the antigen was unknown, we decided to convert the IgM (µ) to IgG (γ) version. After cDNA for the antibody was obtained by RACE PCR, we made a series of molecules with different combinations of IgM and IgG domains. Whereas VH-Cµ1-Cµ2-Cγ3 and VH-Cµ1-Cµ2-Hinge-Cγ2-Cγ3 functionally bound to the antigen, VH-Cγ1-Hinge-Cγ2-Cγ3, VH-Cµ1-Hinge-Cγ2-Cγ3, and VH-Cµ1-Cµ2-Cγ2-Cγ3 did not. Gel filtration analyses revealed that the functional molecules tend to form multimers and the multimeric forms retained antigen binding activity. Furthermore, the mutation of amino acid residue p.309Q > C of mouse IgG and addition of IgM tailpiece to the C-terminus of the molecules induced multimer formation, dramatically enhanced antibody functionality and all non-functional molecules became strongly functional. The functional molecules could be bound by protein A/protein G and other IgG specific reagents and therefore should be useful for further characterization of the antigen. Our study revealed that multimerization of converted IgM is functionally important for antigen binding activity of engineered IgM/IgG chimeric antibodies.",

However, the potential toxicity of Tub-A on oocyte maturation and asymmetric division is still unclear. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the effect and potential regulatory role of Tub-A on the meiotic maturation of oocytes. We observed that Tub-A treatment induced an increased level of the acetylation of α-tubulin, and a failure of spindle migration and actin cap formation. Based on the spindle structure, most Tub-A treated oocytes were arrested in an MI-like or a GVBD-like stage and exhibited decondensed chromosomes in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, Tub-A treatment decreased the protein expression of mTOR, a factor responsible for spindle formation, and the expression of mDia1, an inhibitor of actin assembly, in an HDAC6 expression-dependent manner. Importantly, following Tub-A supplementation, most oocytes failed to extrude the first polar body, which indicates that these defects are closely linked to abnormal oocyte maturation. Taken together, our data demonstrates that HDAC6 is one of the essential factors for oocyte maturation and asymmetric division via the HDAC6/mTOR or mDia1 pathway in mice.",

    "abstract": "The prognostic value of routine laboratory variables in breast cancer has been largely overlooked. Based on laboratory tests commonly performed in clinical practice, we aimed to develop a new model to predict disease free survival (DFS) after surgical removal of primary breast cancer. In a cohort of 1,596 breast cancer patients, we analyzed the associations of 33 laboratory variables with patient DFS. Based on 3 significant laboratory variables (hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, and international normalized ratio), together with important demographic and clinical variables, we developed a prognostic model, achieving the area under the curve of 0.79. We categorized patients into 3 risk groups according to the prognostic index developed from the final model. Compared with the patients in the low-risk group, those in the medium- and high-risk group had a significantly increased risk of recurrence with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.75 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-2.38) and 4.66 (95% CI 3.54-6.14), respectively. The results from the training set were validated in the testing set. Overall, our prognostic model incorporating readily available routine laboratory tests is powerful in identifying breast cancer patients who are at high risk of recurrence. Further study is warranted to validate its clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence shows that granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has progression-promoting potentials in certain solid tumors, which is largely attributed to the immunomodulatory function of this cytokine in tumor niches. However, little is known about the effect of GM-CSF on cancer cells. Herein, we show that chronic exposure of colon cancer cells to GM-CSF, which harbor its receptor, leads to occurrence of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), in time and dose-dependent manners. These GM-CSF-educated cancer cells exhibit enhanced ability of motility in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, GM-CSF stimulation renders colon cancer cells more resistant to cytotoxic agents. Mechanistic investigation reveals that MAPK/ERK signaling and EMT-inducing transcription factor ZEB1 are critical to mediate these effects of GM-CSF. In specimen of CRC patients, high-level expression of GM-CSF positively correlates with local metastases in lymph nodes. Moreover, the co-expression of GM-CSF and its receptors as well as phosphorylated ERK1/2 are observed. Thus, our study for the first time identifies a progression-promoting function of GM-CSF in colon cancer by inducing EMT.",

In the development of hPSC-derived CTPs, it is imperative to ensure that they do not form tumors after transplantation for safety reasons. Because cellular immortalization is a landmark of malignant transformation and a common feature of cancer cells, we aimed to develop an in vitro assay for detecting immortalized cells in CTPs. We employed retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells as a model of hPSC-derived products and identified a gene encoding slow skeletal muscle troponin T (TNNT1) as a novel marker of immortalized RPE cells by comprehensive microarray analysis. TNNT1 mRNA was commonly upregulated in immortalized RPE cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which have self-renewal ability. Additionally, we demonstrated that TNNT1 mRNA expression is higher in several cancer tissues than in normal tissues. Furthermore, stable expression of TNNT1 in ARPE-19 cells affected actin filament organization and enhanced their migration ability. Finally, we established a simple and rapid qRT-PCR assay targeting TNNT1 transcripts that detected as low as 3% of ARPE-19 cells contained in normal primary RPE cells. Purified hiPSC-derived RPE cells showed TNNT1 expression levels below the detection limit determined with primary RPE cells. Our qRT-PCR method is expected to greatly contribute to process validation and quality control of CTPs.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput technologies have identified significant changes in patterns of mRNA expression over cancer development but the functional significance of these changes often rests upon the assumption that observed changes in levels of mRNA accurately reflect changes in levels of their encoded proteins. We systematically compared the expression of 4436 genes on the RNA and protein levels between discrete tumor samples collected from the ovary and from the omentum of the same OC patient. The overall correlation between global changes in levels of mRNA and their encoding proteins is low (r = 0.38). The majority of differences are on the protein level with no corresponding change on the mRNA level. Indirect and direct evidence indicates that a significant fraction of the differences may be mediated by microRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Despite improvement in preoperative imaging, surgical technique, and adjuvant therapy, the prognosis of patients with tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is still unsatisfactory. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) play a key role in the regulation of tumor cell proliferation and survival. However, the significance of mTOR on the prognosis of tongue SCC remains largely undefined. In the present study, immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the expression of phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR) in 160 surgically resected tongue SCC, and correlated with survival. Univariate analysis revealed that p-mTOR overexpression (P = 0.006) was associated with inferior overall survival. In multivariate comparison, p-mTOR overexpression (P = 0.002, hazard ratio = 2.082) remained independently associated with worse overall survival. In vitro study, tongue cancer cells treated with everolimus, the specific mTOR inhibitor, or transfected with mTOR-mediated siRNAs dramatically attenuated the abilities of cell proliferation by MTT and BrdU assays. In 4-NQO-induced tongue cancer murine model, mTOR inhibitors significantly decreased the incidence of tongue SCC. In conclusion, p-mTOR overexpression was independently associated with poor prognosis of patients with tongue SCC. In vitro and vivo, mTOR inhibition showed the promising activity in tongue SCC. Our results suggest that inhibition of mTOR signaling pathway may be a novel therapeutic target for tongue SCC.",

    "abstract": "Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is an inflammatory disease of the peripheral nervous system. Given that plasma metabolic profiles in GBS patients have never been explored, plasma samples of 38 GBS patients, 22 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, and 40 healthy controls were analyzed by using untargeted and targeted metabolomics analysis. The untargeted analysis showed that levels of a set of plasma lipid metabolites were significantly decreased in GBS patients compared to the controls. Furthermore, the targeted analysis demonstrated that levels of 41 metabolites in GBS patients were significantly changed compared to either the controls or MS patients. A further metabolic analysis showed that 12 of 41 metabolites were significantly lower in classical GBS patients compared to Miller-Fisher syndrome. Among them, each of PCae C34:0, PCae C42:2, PCae C42:3, and SM C24:0 was inversely correlated with Hughes functional grading scale of GBS patients at both nadir and discharge. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of combination of three metabolites (PCaa C42:2, PCae C36:0 and SM C24:0) showed a good discrimination between the GBS and the controls (area under curve = 0.86). This study has demonstrated disruption of lipid metabolites in GBS may be potential biomarkers to indicate disease severity and prognosis of GBS.",

    "abstract": "Lichens are symbiotic organisms that produce various secondary metabolites. Here, different lichen extracts were examined to identify secondary metabolites with anti-migratory activity against human lung cancer cells. Everniastrum vexans had the most potent inhibitory activity, and atranorin was identified as an active subcomponent of this extract. Atranorin suppressed β-catenin-mediated TOPFLASH activity by inhibiting the nuclear import of β-catenin and downregulating β-catenin/LEF and c-jun/AP-1 downstream target genes such as CD44, cyclin-D1 and c-myc. Atranorin decreased KAI1 C-terminal interacting tetraspanin (KITENIN)-mediated AP-1 activity and the activity of the KITENIN 3'-untranslated region. The nuclear distribution of the AP-1 transcriptional factor, including c-jun and c-fos, was suppressed in atranorin-treated cells, and atranorin inhibited the activity of Rho GTPases including Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA, whereas it had no effect on epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers. STAT-luciferase activity and nuclear STAT levels were decreased, whereas total STAT levels were moderately reduced. The human cell motility and lung cancer RT² Profiler PCR Arrays identified additional atranorin target genes. Atranorin significantly inhibited tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results indicated that E. vexans and its subcomponent atranorin may inhibit lung cancer cell motility and tumorigenesis by affecting AP-1, Wnt, and STAT signaling and suppressing RhoGTPase activity.",

    "abstract": "In recent studies, miRNAs have been found to be extremely influential in many of the essential biological processes. They exhibit a self-regulatory mechanism through which they act as positive/negative regulators of expression of genes and other miRNAs. This has direct implications in the regulation of various pathophysiological conditions, signaling pathways and different types of cancers. Studying miRNA-disease associations has been an extensive area of research; however deciphering miRNA-miRNA network regulatory patterns in several diseases remains a challenge. In this study, we use information diffusion theory to quantify the influence diffusion in a miRNA-miRNA regulation network across multiple disease categories. Our proposed methodology determines the critical disease specific miRNAs which play a causal role in their signaling cascade and hence may regulate disease progression. We extensively validate our framework using existing computational tools from the literature. Furthermore, we implement our framework on a comprehensive miRNA expression data set for alcohol dependence and identify the causal miRNAs for alcohol-dependency in patients which were validated by the phase-shift in their expression scores towards the early stages of the disease. Finally, our computational framework for identifying causal miRNAs implicated in diseases is available as a free online tool for the greater scientific community.",

The interactome is the deepest reported to date. miRNA targeting principles are consistent with observations in other species, but with expanded pairing rules. Experimental mapping robustly predicted functional miR-17 regulatory sites. From miRNA-specific targeting for >5000 mRNAs we determined gene ontologies (GO). This confirmed repression of genes important for embryonic development and cell cycle progress by the let-7 family, and repression of those involved in cell cycle arrest by the miR-17 family, but also suggested a number of unappreciated miRNA functions.

Previous studies suggest that peripheral tumors elicit central pro-inflammatory cytokine production, in turn leading to depression and cognitive deficits. In the current study, two cohorts of female Balb/C mice received bilateral orthotopic injections of syngeneic 67NR, 4T07, or 4T1cells (1 × 10(5) cells per injection) to induce mammary tumors. Approximately three weeks later, learned fear (via fear conditioning) or depressive-like behavior (via tail suspension and forced swim test) was assessed. Proinflammatory cytokine levels were increased in the serum (IL-1β, TNFα, IFNγ) and livers (IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα) of mice with 4T07 or 4T1 tumors compared to 67NR tumors and the vehicle control. IL-1β was increased in both the hippocampus and cortex of mice injected with 4T07 or 4T1 cell lines relative to the other treatment groups. However, mammary tumors had no effect on hippocampal doublecortin + and did not alter depressive-like behavior or learned fear. These data demonstrate that similarly sized tumors can produce differential immune responses and that tumor-induced central pro-inflammatory cytokine production can exist in the absence of depressive-like behavior or cognitive deficits.",

Melanoma cells treated using these agents are known to exhibit increased levels of melanin pigment and tyrosinase activity. In this study we assessed the potential of non-invasive imaging approaches (photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) to detect melanin induction in SKMEL28 human melanoma cells, following inhibition of Hsp90 and BRAF signaling using 17-AAG and vemurafenib, respectively. We confirmed, using western blot and spectrophotometry, that Hsp90 or BRAF inhibitor-induced melanoma cell differentiation resulted in an upregulation of tyrosinase and melanin expression levels, in comparison to control cells. This post-treatment increase in cellular pigmentation induced a significant increase in PAI signals that are spectrally identifiable and shortening of the MRI relaxation times T 1 and [Formula: see text]. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the potential of MRI and PAI for detecting the downstream cellular changes induced by Hsp90 and BRAF-MEK-targeted therapies in melanoma cells with potential significance for in vivo imaging.",

    "abstract": "We compared the efficacy and complications of core-needle biopsy (CNB) with those of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in a large population of patients with initially detected thyroid nodules via a propensity score analysis. Outpatients with initially detected thyroid nodules, who had undergone CNB or FNA between January 2013 and December 2013, were selected. This study included 4,822 thyroid nodules from 4,553 consecutive patients. Adjustments for significant differences in patients' baseline characteristics were facilitated via propensity score analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed according to nodule sizes ≥ 1 cm. The non-diagnostic result rate, malignancy rate, complication rate, and diagnostic accuracy were compared. A 1:1 matching of 1,615 patients yielded no significant differences between two groups for any covariate. The non-diagnostic result rate was significantly lower in the core-needle biopsy group than in the fine-needle aspiration group (5.2% vs. 12.1%), while the malignancy rate (23.7% vs. 11.8%) and sensitivity (75.9% vs. 55.6%) were significantly higher. However, the specificities were similar (100% and 99.9%, respectively). Propensity score and subgroup analyses showed similar results. The complication rate was similar between groups in matched cohorts. CNB is a promising and safe diagnostic tool for patients with initially detected thyroid nodules.",

Here we show that, in addition, PtpA enters the nucleus of host cells and regulates the expression of host genes, some of which are known to be involved in host innate immunity or in cell proliferation and migration (such as GADD45A). PtpA can bind directly to the promoter region of GADD45A in vitro. Both phosphatase activity and DNA-binding ability of PtpA are important in suppressing host innate immune responses. Furthermore, PtpA-expressing Mycobacterium bovis BCG promotes proliferation and migration of human lung adenoma A549 cells in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model. Further research is needed to test whether mycobacteria, via PtpA, might affect cell proliferation or migration in humans. Mycobacterium tuberculosis secretes a protein, PtpA, that dephosphorylates proteins in the host cell cytoplasm, weakening immune responses. Here, the authors show that PtpA also enters the nucleus, affects the expression of several host genes, and promotes proliferation and migration of a cancer cell line.",

    "abstract": "Induction of thrombosis in tumor vasculature represents an appealing strategy for combating cancer. Herein, we combined unique intrinsic coagulation properties of staphylocoagulase with new acquired functional potentials introduced by genetic engineering, to generate a novel bi-functional fusion protein consisting of truncated coagulase (tCoa) bearing an RGD motif on its C-terminus for cancer therapy. We demonstrated that free coagulase failed to elicit any significant thrombotic activity. Conversely, RGD delivery of coagulase retained coagulase activity and afforded favorable interaction of fusion proteins with prothrombin and αvβ3 endothelial cell receptors, as verified by in silico, in vitro, and in vivo experiments. Although free coagulase elicited robust coagulase activity in vitro, only targeted coagulase (tCoa-RGD) was capable of producing extensive thrombosis, and subsequent infarction and massive necrosis of CT26 mouse colon, 4T1 mouse mammary and SKOV3 human ovarian tumors in mice. Additionally, systemic injections of lower doses of tCoa-RGD produced striking tumor growth inhibition of CT26, 4T1 and SKOV3 solid tumors in animals. Altogether, the nontoxic nature, unique shortcut mechanism, minimal effective dose, wide therapeutic window, efficient induction of thrombosis, local effects and susceptibility of human blood to coagulase suggest tCoa-RGD fusion proteins as a novel and promising anticancer therapy for human trials.",

    "abstract": "Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) targeting the androgen receptor (AR) is a standard therapeutic regimen for treating prostate cancer. However, most tumors progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after ADT. We identified the type 1, 2, and 4 collagen-binding protein transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-induced protein (TGFBI) as an important factor in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignant progression of prostate cancer. In prostate cancer cell lines, AR signaling stimulated the activity of the transcription factor SPDEF, which repressed the expression of TGFBI ADT, AR antagonism, or overexpression of TGFBI inhibited the activity of SPDEF and enhanced the proliferation rates of prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of TGFBI suppressed migration and proliferation in cultured cells and reduced prostate tumor growth and brain and bone metastasis in xenograft models, extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Analysis of prostate tissue samples collected before and after ADT from the same patients showed that ADT reduced the nuclear abundance of SPDEF and increased the production of TGFBI. Our findings suggest that induction of TGFBI promotes prostate cancer growth and metastasis and can be caused by dysregulation or therapeutic inhibition of AR signaling.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a deadly cancer, and its prognosis has not been changed significantly during several decades. To seek new therapeutic targets for EOC, we performed an in vivo dropout screen in human tumor xenografts using a pooled shRNA library targeting thousands of druggable genes. Then, in follow-up studies, we performed a second screen using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 library. These screens identified 10 high-confidence drug targets that included well-known oncogenes such as ERBB2 and RAF1, and novel oncogenes, notably KPNB1, which we investigated further. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition showed that KPNB1 exerts its antitumor effects through multiphase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. Mechanistically, proteomic studies revealed that KPNB1 acts as a master regulator of cell cycle-related proteins, including p21, p27, and APC/C. Clinically, EOC patients with higher expression levels of KPNB1 showed earlier recurrence and worse prognosis than those with lower expression levels of KPNB1. Interestingly, ivermectin, a Food and Drug Administration-approved antiparasitic drug, showed KPNB1-dependent antitumor effects on EOC, serving as an alternative therapeutic toward EOC patients through drug repositioning. Last, we found that the combination of ivermectin and paclitaxel produces a stronger antitumor effect on EOC both in vitro and in vivo than either drug alone. Our studies have thus identified a combinatorial therapy for EOC, in addition to a plethora of potential drug targets.",

How the exquisite specificity of high-avidity T cells is achieved is unknown but essential, given the paucity of foreign pMHC ligands relative to the ubiquitous self-pMHC array on an APC. Using optical traps, we determine physicochemical triggering thresholds based on load and force direction. Strikingly, chemical thresholds in the absence of external load require orders of magnitude higher pMHC numbers than observed physiologically. In contrast, force applied in the shear direction ([Formula: see text]10 pN per TCR molecule) triggers T-cell Ca(2+) flux with as few as two pMHC molecules at the interacting surface interface with rapid positional relaxation associated with similarly directed motor-dependent transport via [Formula: see text]8-nm steps, behaviors inconsistent with serial engagement during initial TCR triggering. These synergistic directional forces generated during cell motility are essential for adaptive T-cell immunity against infectious pathogens and cancers.",

    "abstract": "Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progresses rapidly and is incurable. Constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants (AR-Vs) represent a well-established mechanism of therapeutic resistance and disease progression. These variants lack the AR ligand-binding domain and, as such, are not inhibited by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which is the standard systemic approach for advanced PC. Signaling by AR-Vs, including the clinically relevant AR-V7, is augmented by Vav3, an established AR coactivator in CRPC. Using mutational and biochemical studies, we demonstrated that the Vav3 Diffuse B-cell lymphoma homology (DH) domain interacted with the N-terminal region of AR-V7 (and full length AR). Expression of the Vav3 DH domain disrupted Vav3 interaction with and enhancement of AR-V7 activity. The Vav3 DH domain also disrupted AR-V7 interaction with other AR coactivators: Src1 and Vav2, which are overexpressed in PC. This Vav3 domain was used in proof-of-concept studies to evaluate the effects of disrupting the interaction between AR-V7 and its coactivators on CRPC cells. This disruption decreased CRPC cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth, caused increased apoptosis, decreased migration, and resulted in the acquisition of morphological changes associated with a less aggressive phenotype. While disrupting the interaction between FL-AR and its coactivators decreased N-C terminal interaction, disrupting the interaction of AR-V7 with its coactivators decreased AR-V7 nuclear levels.IMPLICATIONS: This study demonstrates the potential therapeutic utility of inhibiting constitutively active AR-V signaling by disrupting coactivator binding. Such an approach is significant, as AR-Vs are emerging as important drivers of CRPC that are particularly recalcitrant to current therapies.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian nuclear envelope (NE) forms a stable physical barrier between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, normally breaking down only during the cell cycle phase of mitosis. However, spontaneous transient NE rupture in interphase can occur when NE integrity is compromised such as when the nucleus experiences mechanical stress. For instance, deficiencies in the nuclear lamins and their associated proteins can cause NE rupture that is promoted by forces exerted by actin filaments. NE rupture can allow cytoplasmic nucleases to access chromatin, potentially compromising genome integrity. Importantly, spontaneous NE rupture was noted in several human cancer cell lines but the cause of this defect is not known. Here, we investigated the mechanistic contributions of two major tumor suppressors, p53 (TP53) and Rb (RB1), to the repression of NE rupture. NE rupture was induced in normal human epithelial RPE-1 cells upon impairment of either Rb or p53 achieved by shRNA knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. NE rupture did not involve diminished expression of NE components or greater cell motility. However, cells that underwent NE rupture displayed a larger nuclear projection area. In conclusion, the data indicate that NE rupture in cancer cells is likely due to loss of either the Rb or the p53 pathway.IMPLICATIONS: These findings imply that tumor suppression by Rb and p53 includes the ability to prevent NE rupture, thereby protecting against genome alterations.",

    "abstract": "Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a central role in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). The Wnt-transcription factor, TCF7L2, is overexpressed in primary rectal cancers that are resistant to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and TCF7L2 mediates resistance to CRT. However, it is unclear whether the resistance is mediated by a TCF7L2 inherent mechanism or Wnt/β-catenin signaling in general. Here, inhibition of β-catenin by siRNAs or a small molecule inhibitor (XAV-939) resulted in sensitization of CRC cells to CRT. To investigate the potential role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in controlling therapeutic responsiveness, non-tumorigenic RPE-1 cells were stimulated with Wnt-3a, a physiological ligand of Frizzled-receptors, which increased resistance to CRT. This effect could be recapitulated by overexpression of a degradation-resistant mutant of β-catenin (S33Y), also boosting resistance of RPE-1 cells to CRT, which was, conversely, abrogated by siRNA-mediated silencing of β-catenin. Consistent with these findings, higher expression levels of active β-catenin were observed as well as increased TCF/LEF reporter activity in SW1463 cells that evolved radiation resistance due to repeated radiation treatment. Global gene expression profiling identified several altered pathways, including PPAR signaling and other metabolic pathways, associated with cellular response to radiation. In summary, aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling not only regulates the development and progression of colorectal cancer, but also mediates resistance of rectal cancers to chemoradiotherapy.IMPLICATIONS: Targeting Wnt/β-catenin signaling or one of the downstream pathways represents a promising strategy to increase response to CRT.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of baricitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) up to 128 weeks in a phase IIb study (NCT01185353).METHODS: After a 24-week blinded period, eligible patients entered an initial 52-week open-label extension (OLE); patients receiving 8 mg once daily (QD) continued with that dose and all others received 4 mg QD. Doses could be escalated to 8 mg QD at 28 or 32 weeks at investigator discretion when ≥ 6 tender and ≥ 6 swollen joints were present. Patients completing the first OLE were eligible to enter a second 52-week OLE and receive 4 mg QD regardless of previous dose.RESULTS: In the 4-mg (n = 108) and 8-mg (n = 93) groups, treatment-emergent adverse events (AE) occurred in 63% and 67%, serious AE in 16% and 13%, infections in 35% and 40%, and serious infections in 5% and 3% of patients, respectively. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates for AE for all baricitinib groups in the second OLE were similar to or lower than rates observed in the first OLE. No opportunistic infections, tuberculosis cases, or lymphomas were observed through 128 weeks; 1 death occurred during the first OLE. Among all patients in both OLE, the proportions who achieved disease improvement at Week 24 were similar or increased at weeks 76 and 128.CONCLUSION: In a phase IIb study in RA, the safety and tolerability profile of baricitinib, up to 128 weeks, remained consistent with earlier observations, without unexpected late signals. Clinical improvements seen in the 24-week blinded period were maintained during the OLE.",

    "abstract": "While glutamine is a nonessential amino acid that can be synthesized from glucose, some cancer cells primarily depend on glutamine for their growth, proliferation, and survival. Numerous types of cancer also depend on asparagine for cell proliferation. The underlying mechanisms of the glutamine and asparagine requirement in cancer cells in different contexts remain unclear. In this study, we show that the oncogenic virus Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) accelerates the glutamine metabolism of glucose-independent proliferation of cancer cells by upregulating the expression of numerous critical enzymes, including glutaminase 2 (GLS2), glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1), and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2), to support cell proliferation. Surprisingly, cell crisis is rescued only completely by supplementation with asparagine but minimally by supplementation with α-ketoglutarate, aspartate, or glutamate upon glutamine deprivation, implying an essential role of γ-nitrogen in glutamine and asparagine for cell proliferation. Specifically, glutamine and asparagine provide the critical γ-nitrogen for purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, as knockdown of four rate-limiting enzymes in the pathways, including carbamoylphosphate synthetase 2 (CAD), phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT), and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetases 1 and 2 (PRPS1 and PRPS2, respectively), suppresses cell proliferation. These findings indicate that glutamine and asparagine are shunted to the biosynthesis of nucleotides and nonessential amino acids from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to support the anabolic proliferation of KSHV-transformed cells. Our results illustrate a novel mechanism by which an oncogenic virus hijacks a metabolic pathway for cell proliferation and imply potential therapeutic applications in specific types of cancer that depend on this pathway.IMPORTANCE We have previously found that Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) can efficiently infect and transform primary mesenchymal stem cells; however, the metabolic pathways supporting the anabolic proliferation of KSHV-transformed cells remain unknown.

In this study, we have found that KSHV accelerates glutamine metabolism by upregulating numerous critical metabolic enzymes.

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori is a bacterial pathogen that colonizes the human stomach, causing inflammation which, in some cases, leads to gastric ulcers and cancer. The clinical outcome of infection depends on a complex interplay of bacterial, host genetic, and environmental factors. Although H. pylori is recognized by both the innate and adaptive immune systems, this rarely results in bacterial clearance. Gastric epithelial cells are the first line of defense against H. pylori and alert the immune system to bacterial presence. Cytosolic delivery of proinflammatory bacterial factors through the cag type 4 secretion system (cag-T4SS) has long been appreciated as the major mechanism by which gastric epithelial cells detect H. pylori Classically attributed to the peptidoglycan sensor NOD1, recent work has highlighted the role of NOD1-independent pathways in detecting H. pylori; however, the bacterial and host factors involved have remained unknown. Here, we show that bacterially derived heptose-1,7-bisphosphate (HBP), a metabolic precursor in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis, is delivered to the host cytosol through the cag-T4SS, where it activates the host tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-interacting protein with forkhead-associated domain (TIFA)-dependent cytosolic surveillance pathway. This response, which is independent of NOD1, drives robust NF-κB-dependent inflammation within hours of infection and precedes NOD1 activation. We also found that the CagA toxin contributes to the NF-κB-driven response subsequent to TIFA and NOD1 activation. Taken together, our results indicate that the sequential activation of TIFA, NOD1, and CagA delivery drives the initial inflammatory response in gastric epithelial cells, orchestrating the subsequent recruitment of immune cells and leading to chronic gastritis.IMPORTANCEH. pylori is a globally prevalent cause of gastric and duodenal ulcers and cancer. H. pylori antibiotic resistance is rapidly increasing, and a vaccine remains elusive. The earliest immune response to H. pylori is initiated by gastric epithelial cells and sets the stage for the subsequent immunopathogenesis. This study revealed that host TIFA and H. pylori-derived HBP are critical effectors of innate immune signaling that account for much of the inflammatory response to H. pylori in gastric epithelial cells. HBP is delivered to the host cell via the cag-T4SS at a time point that precedes activation of the previously described NOD1 and CagA inflammatory pathways. Manipulation of the TIFA-driven immune response in the host and/or targeting of ADP-heptose biosynthesis enzymes in H. pylori may therefore provide novel strategies that may be therapeutically harnessed to achieve bacterial clearance.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic regulation is based on a network of complexes that modulate the chromatin character and structure of the genome to impact gene expression, cell fate, and development. Thus, epigenetic modulators represent novel therapeutic targets used to treat a range of diseases, including malignancies. Infectious pathogens such as herpesviruses are also regulated by cellular epigenetic machinery, and epigenetic therapeutics represent a novel approach used to control infection, persistence, and the resulting recurrent disease. The histone H3K27 methyltransferases EZH2 and EZH1 (EZH2/1) are epigenetic repressors that suppress gene transcription via propagation of repressive H3K27me3-enriched chromatin domains. However, while EZH2/1 are implicated in the repression of herpesviral gene expression, inhibitors of these enzymes suppressed primary herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in vitro and in vivo Furthermore, these compounds blocked lytic viral replication following induction of HSV reactivation in latently infected sensory ganglia. Suppression correlated with the induction of multiple inflammatory, stress, and antipathogen pathways, as well as enhanced recruitment of immune cells to in vivo infection sites. Importantly, EZH2/1 inhibitors induced a cellular antiviral state that also suppressed infection with DNA (human cytomegalovirus, adenovirus) and RNA (Zika virus) viruses. Thus, EZH2/1 inhibitors have considerable potential as general antivirals through the activation of cellular antiviral and immune responses.IMPORTANCE A significant proportion of the world's population is infected with herpes simplex virus. Primary infection and subsequent recurrent reactivation can result in diseases ranging from mild lesions to severe ocular or neurological damage. Herpesviruses are subject to epigenetic regulation that modulates viral gene expression, lytic replication, and latency-reactivation cycles. Thus, epigenetic pharmaceuticals have the potential to alter the course of infection and disease. Here, while the histone methyltransferases EZH2/1 are implicated in the suppression of herpesviruses, inhibitors of these repressors unexpectedly suppress viral infection in vitro and in vivo by induction of key components of cellular innate defense pathways. These inhibitors suppress infection by multiple viral pathogens, indicating their potential as broad-spectrum antivirals.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the role of iron deprivation in the persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis We present evidence of iron restriction in human necrotic granulomas and demonstrate that under iron starvation M. tuberculosis persists, refractive to antibiotics and capable of restarting replication when iron is made available. Transcriptomics and metabolomic analyses indicated that the persistence of M. tuberculosis under iron starvation is dependent on strict control of endogenous Fe utilization and is associated with upregulation of pathogenicity and intrinsic antibiotic resistance determinants. M. tuberculosis mutants compromised in their ability to survive Fe starvation were identified. The findings of this study advance the understanding of the physiological settings that may underpin the chronicity of human tuberculosis (TB) and are relevant to the design of effective antitubercular therapies.IMPORTANCE One-third of the world population may harbor persistent M. tuberculosis, causing an asymptomatic infection that is refractory to treatment and can reactivate to become potentially lethal tuberculosis disease. However, little is known about the factors that trigger and maintain M. tuberculosis persistence in infected individuals. Iron is an essential nutrient for M. tuberculosis growth. In this study, we show, first, that in human granulomas the immune defense creates microenvironments in which M. tuberculosis likely experiences drastic Fe deprivation and, second, that Fe-starved M. tuberculosis is capable of long-term persistence without growth. Together, these observations suggest that Fe deprivation in the lung might trigger a state of persistence in M. tuberculosis and promote chronic TB. We also identified vulnerabilities of iron-restricted persistent M. tuberculosis, which can be exploited for the design of new antitubercular therapies.",

    "abstract": "Yellow fever virus (YFV) is an arthropod-borne flavivirus, infecting ~200,000 people worldwide annually and causing about 30,000 deaths. The live attenuated vaccine strain, YFV-17D, has significantly contributed in controlling the global burden of yellow fever worldwide. However, the viral and host contributions to YFV-17D attenuation remain elusive. Type I interferon (IFN-α/β) signaling and type II interferon (IFN-γ) signaling have been shown to be mutually supportive in controlling YFV-17D infection despite distinct mechanisms of action in viral infection. However, it remains unclear how type III IFN (IFN-λ) integrates into this antiviral system. Here, we report that while wild-type (WT) and IFN-λ receptor knockout (λR(-/-)) mice were largely resistant to YFV-17D, deficiency in type I IFN signaling resulted in robust infection. Although IFN-α/β receptor knockout (α/βR(-/-)) mice survived the infection, mice with combined deficiencies in both type I signaling and type III IFN signaling were hypersusceptible to YFV-17D and succumbed to the infection. Mortality was associated with viral neuroinvasion and increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). α/βR(-/-) λR(-/-) mice also exhibited distinct changes in the frequencies of multiple immune cell lineages, impaired T-cell activation, and severe perturbation of the proinflammatory cytokine balance. Taken together, our data highlight that type III IFN has critical immunomodulatory and neuroprotective functions that prevent viral neuroinvasion during active YFV-17D replication. Type III IFN thus likely represents a safeguard mechanism crucial for controlling YFV-17D infection and contributing to shaping vaccine immunogenicity.IMPORTANCE YFV-17D is a live attenuated flavivirus vaccine strain recognized as one of the most effective vaccines ever developed. However, the host and viral determinants governing YFV-17D attenuation and its potent immunogenicity are still unknown. Here, we analyzed the role of type III interferon (IFN)-mediated signaling, a host immune defense mechanism, in controlling YFV-17D infection and attenuation in different mouse models. We uncovered a critical role of type III IFN-mediated signaling in preserving the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and preventing viral brain invasion. Type III IFN also played a major role in regulating the induction of a potent but balanced immune response that prevented viral evasion of the host immune system. An improved understanding of the complex mechanisms regulating YFV-17D attenuation will provide insights into the key virus-host interactions that regulate host immune responses and infection outcomes as well as open novel avenues for the development of innovative vaccine strategies.",

    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare disease, in which homozygous or compound heterozygous inactivating mutations in any of 21 genes lead to genomic instability, early-onset bone marrow failure and increased cancer risk. The FA pathway is essential for DNA damage response (DDR) to DNA interstrand crosslinks. However, proteins of the FA pathway have additional cytoprotective functions that may be independent of DDR. We have shown that many FA proteins participate in the selective autophagy pathway that is required for the destruction of unwanted intracellular constituents. In this Cell Science at a Glance and the accompanying poster, we briefly review the role of the FA pathway in DDR and recent findings that link proteins of the FA pathway to selective autophagy of viruses and mitochondria. Finally, we discuss how perturbations in FA protein-mediated selective autophagy may contribute to inflammatory as well as genotoxic stress.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is moderately responsive to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, the most widely used single agent therapy for pancreatic cancer. While the prognosis in pancreatic cancer remains grim in part due to poor response to therapy, previous attempts at identifying and targeting the resistance mechanisms have not been very successful. By leveraging TCGA dataset, we identified lipid metabolism as the metabolic pathway that most significantly correlated with poor gemcitabine response in pancreatic cancer patients. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between alterations in lipogenesis pathway and gemcitabine resistance by utilizing tissues from the genetically engineered mouse model and human pancreatic cancer patients. We observed a significant increase in fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression with increasing disease progression in a spontaneous pancreatic cancer mouse model, and a correlation of high FASN expression with poor survival in patients and poor gemcitabine responsiveness in cell lines. We observed a synergistic effect of FASN inhibitors with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells in culture and orthotopic implantation models. Combination of gemcitabine and the FASN inhibitor orlistat significantly diminished stemness, in part due to induction of ER stress that resulted in apoptosis. Moreover, direct induction of ER stress with thapsigargin caused a similar decrease in stemness and showed synergistic activity with gemcitabine. Our in vivo studies with orthotopic implantation models demonstrated a robust increase in gemcitabine responsiveness upon inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis with orlistat. Altogether, we demonstrate that fatty acid biosynthesis pathway manipulation can help overcome the gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer by regulating ER stress and stemness.",

Androgen receptor (AR) splice variants including AR-V7 function as constitutively active transcription factors in CRPC cells, thereby promoting resistance to AR-targeted therapies. To date, there are no AR variant specific treatments for CRPC. Here we report that the splicing of AR variants AR-V7 as well as AR-V1 and AR-V9 is regulated coordinately by a single polyadenylation signal in AR intron 3. Blocking this signal with morpholino technology or silencing of the polyadenylation factor CPSF1 caused a splice switch that inhibited expression of AR variants and blocked androgen-independent growth of CRPC cells. Our findings support the development of new therapies targeting the polyadenylation signal in AR intron 3 as a strategy to prevent expression of a broad array of AR variants in CRPC.",

    "abstract": "The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a reversible process comprised of various subprograms via which epithelial cells reduce their intercellular adhesions and proliferative capacity while gaining a mesenchymal phenotype with increased migratory and invasive properties. This process has been well described in several carcinomas, which are cancers of epithelial origin, and is crucial to metastatic tumor cell dissemination and drug resistance. In contrast, the precise role of EMT-related processes in tumors originating from mesenchymal tissues, such as bone and soft-tissues sarcomas, is still largely unclear. In fact, although the existence of the EMT in sarcomas appears paradoxical because these cancers are, by definition, mesenchymal ab initio, accumulating evidence suggests that many sarcomas can undergo EMT-related processes, which may be associated with aggressive clinical behavior. These processes may be especially operative in certain sarcoma subtypes, such as carcinosarcomas displaying a biphenotypic morphology with characteristics of both mesenchymal and epithelial tumors. In this review, we discuss findings regarding the potential existence of EMT-related processes in sarcomas and propose that sarcomas can reside in a metastable state, enabling them to become either more mesenchymal or epithelial under specific conditions, which likely has important clinical implications.

    "abstract": "Metastatic breast cancer is still remain incurable so far, new specifically targeted and more effective therapies for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) are required in the clinic. In this study, our clinical data has established that basal and claudin-low subtypes of breast cancer (TNBC types) express significantly higher levels of Annexin A1 (ANXA1) with poor survival outcomes. Using human cancer cell lines which model the TNBC subtype, we observed a strong positive correlation between expression of ANXA1 and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPARγ). A similar correlation between these two markers was also established in our clinical breast cancer patients' specimens. To establish a link between these two markers in TNBC, we show de novo expression of ANXA1 is induced by activation of PPARγ both in vitro and invivo and it has a predictive value in determining chemo-sensitivity to PPARγ ligands. Mechanistically, we show for the first time PPARγ-induced ANXA1 protein directly interacts with Receptor Interacting Protein-1 (RIP1), promoting its deubiquitination and thereby activating the caspase 8-dependent death pathway. We further identified this underlying mechanism also involved a PPARγ-induced ANXA1-dependent autoubiquitination of cIAP1, the direct E3 ligase of RIP1, shifting cIAP1 towards proteosomal degradation. Collectively, our study provides first insight for the suitability of using drug-induced expression of ANXA1 as a new player in RIP1-induced death machinery in TNBCs. Hitherto, presenting itself both as an inclusion criterion for patient selection and surrogate marker for drug response in future PPARγ chemotherapy trials.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that IL-22, one of the Th17 cell-related cytokines, plays multiple roles in regulating allergic airway inflammation caused by antigen-specific Th2 cells; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that allergic airway inflammation and Th2 and Th17 cytokine production upon intratracheal administration of house dust mite (HDM) extract, a representative allergen, were exacerbated in IL-22-deficient mice. We also found that IL-22 induces Reg3γ production from lung epithelial cells through STAT3 activation and that neutralization of Reg3γ significantly exacerbates HDM-induced eosinophilic airway inflammation and Th2 cytokine induction. Moreover, exostatin-like 3 (EXTL3), a functional Reg3γ binding protein, is expressed in lung epithelial cells, and intratracheal administration of recombinant Reg3γ suppresses HDM-induced thymic stromal lymphopoietin and IL-33 expression and accumulation of type 2 innate lymphoid cells in the lung. Collectively, these results suggest that IL-22 induces Reg3γ production from lung epithelial cells and inhibits the development of HDM-induced allergic airway inflammation, possibly by inhibiting cytokine production from lung epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Galectin-8 (Gal-8) is a mammalian β-galactoside-binding lectin, endowed with proinflammatory properties. Given its capacity to enhance antigen-specific immune responses in vivo, we investigated whether Gal-8 was also able to promote APC activation to sustain T cell activation after priming. Both endogenous [dendritic cells (DCs)] and bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) treated with exogenous Gal-8 exhibited a mature phenotype characterized by increased MHC class II (MHCII), CD80, and CD86 surface expression. Moreover, Gal-8-treated BMDCs (Gal-8-BMDCs) stimulated antigen-specific T cells more efficiently than immature BMDCs (iBMDCs). Proinflammatory cytokines IL-3, IL-2, IL-6, TNF, MCP-1, and MCP-5, as well as growth factor G-CSF, were augmented in Gal-8-BMDC conditioned media, with IL-6 as the most prominent. Remarkably, BMDCs from Gal-8-deficient mice (Lgals8(-/-) BMDC) displayed reduced CD86 and IL-6 expression and an impaired ability to promote antigen-specific CD4 T cell activation. To test if Gal-8-induced activation correlates with the elicitation of an effective immune response, soluble Gal-8 was coadministrated with antigen during immunization of BALB/cJ mice in the experimental foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) model. When a single dose of Gal-8 was added to the antigen formulation, an increased specific and neutralizing humoral response was developed, sufficient to enhance animal protection upon viral challenge. IL-6 and IFN-γ, as well as lymphoproliferative responses, were also incremented in Gal-8/antigen-immunized animals only at 48 h after immunization, suggesting that Gal-8 induces the elicitation of an inflammatory response at an early stage. Taking together, these findings argue in favor of the use of Gal-8 as an immune-stimulator molecule to enhance the adaptive immune response.",

    "abstract": "Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) forms cytotoxic oligomers and amyloid fibrils in islets in Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The causal factors for amyloid formation are largely unknown. Mechanisms of molecular folding and assembly of human IAPP (hIAPP) into β-sheets, oligomers and fibrils have been assessed by detailed biophysical studies of hIAPP and non-fibrillogenic, rodent IAPP (rIAPP); cytotoxicity is associated with the early phases (oligomers/multimers) of fibrillogenesis. Interaction with synthetic membranes promotes β-sheet assembly possibly via a transient α-helical molecular conformation. Cellular hIAPP cytotoxicity can be activated from intracellular or extracellular sites. In transgenic rodents overexpressing hIAPP intracellular proapoptotic signals can be generated at different points in β-cell protein synthesis. Increased cellular trafficking of proIAPP, failure of the unfolded protein response (UPR), or excess trafficking of misfolded peptide via the degradation pathways can induce apoptosis; these data indicate that defects in intracellular handling of hIAPP can induce cytotoxicity. However, there is no evidence for IAPP overexpression in T2DM. Extracellular amyloidosis is directly related to the degree of β-cell apoptosis in islets in T2DM. IAPP fragments, fibrils and multimers interact with membranes causing disruption in vivo and in vitro. These findings support a role for extracellular IAPP in β-sheet conformation in cytotoxicity. Inhibitors of fibrillogenesis are useful tools to determine the aberrant mechanisms that result in hIAPP molecular refolding and islet amyloidosis. However, currently, their role as therapeutic agents remains uncertain.",

    "abstract": "Much effort has been dedicated to developing circulating tumor cells (CTC) as a noninvasive cancer biopsy, but with limited success as yet. In this study, we combine a method for isolation of highly pure CTCs using immunomagnetic enrichment/fluorescence-activated cell sorting with advanced whole genome sequencing (WGS), based on long fragment read technology, to illustrate the utility of an accurate, comprehensive, phased, and quantitative genomic analysis platform for CTCs. Whole genomes of 34 CTCs from a patient with metastatic breast cancer were analyzed as 3,072 barcoded subgenomic compartments of long DNA. WGS resulted in a read coverage of 23× per cell and an ensemble call rate of >95%. These barcoded reads enabled accurate detection of somatic mutations present in as few as 12% of CTCs. We found in CTCs a total of 2,766 somatic single-nucleotide variants and 543 indels and multi-base substitutions, 23 of which altered amino acid sequences. Another 16,961 somatic single nucleotide variant and 8,408 indels and multi-base substitutions, 77 of which were nonsynonymous, were detected with varying degrees of prevalence across the 34 CTCs. On the basis of our whole genome data of mutations found in all CTCs, we identified driver mutations and the tissue of origin of these cells, suggesting personalized combination therapies beyond the scope of most gene panels. Taken together, our results show how advanced WGS of CTCs can lead to high-resolution analyses of cancers that can reliably guide personalized therapy. Cancer Res; 77(16); 4530-41. ©2017 AACR.",

    "abstract": "Multiple candidate gene association studies of non-HLA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and outcomes after blood or marrow transplant (BMT) have been conducted. We identified 70 publications reporting 45 SNPs in 36 genes significantly associated with disease-related mortality, progression-free survival, transplant-related mortality and/or overall survival after BMT. Replication and validation of these SNP associations were performed using DISCOVeRY-BMT, a well-powered genome-wide association study consisting of two cohorts, totaling 2,883 BMT recipients with AML, ALL or MDS and their HLA-matched unrelated donors, treated from 2000-2011 and reported to the CIBMTR. Aggregate effects of multiple SNPs within a gene on survival were assessed with gene-based tests using VEGAS2. None of the previously reported significant SNPs replicated at P<0.05 in DISCOVeRY-BMT. Validation analyses showed association with one previously reported donor SNP at P<0.05 and overall survival; given the number of tests we anticipated more associations by chance alone. Gene-based tests of association were not significant at P<0.05 with any outcome. Importantly, functional annotation with publically available data show that these candidate SNPs most likely do not have biochemical function; only 13% of these candidate SNPs correlate with gene expression or are predicted to impact transcription factor binding. Of these, approximately half do not impact the candidate gene of interest, while the other half correlate with expression of multiple genes. These findings emphasize the peril of pursing candidate approaches and the importance of adequately powered tests of unbiased genome-wide associations with BMT clinical outcomes given the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "E-selectin extends from the plasma membrane of inflamed endothelium and serves to capture leukocytes from flowing blood via long-lived catch-bonds that support slow leukocyte rolling under shear stress. Its ligands are glycosylated with the tetrasaccharide sialyl Lewis(x) (sLe(x)), which contributes to bond affinity and specificity. E-selectin mediated rolling transmits signals into neutrophils that triggers activation of high-affinity β2-integrins necessary for transition to shear resistant adhesion and transendothelial migration. Rivipansel is a glycomimetic drug that inhibits E-selectin-mediated vaso-occlusion induced by integrin dependent sickle-RBC-leukocyte adhesion. How Rivipansel antagonizes ligand recognition by E-selectin and blocks outside-in signaling of integrin mediated neutrophil arrest, while maintaining rolling immune-surveillance is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that sLe(x) expressed on human L-selectin is preferentially bound by E-selectin and upon ligation initiates secretion of MRP8/14 that binds TLR4 to elicit the extension of β2-integrin to an intermediate affinity state. Neutrophil rolling over E-selectin at precise shear stress transmits tension and catch-bond formation with L-selectin via sLe(x) resulting in focal clusters that deliver a distinct signal to upshift β2-integrins to a high-affinity state. Rivipansel effectively blocked formation of selectin catch-bonds revealing a novel mechanotransduction circuit that rapidly converts extended β2-integrins to high-affinity shear resistant bond clusters with ICAM-1 on inflamed endothelium.",

    "abstract": "In previous studies, the β-blocker carvedilol inhibited EGF-induced epidermal cell transformation and chemical carcinogen-induced mouse skin hyperplasia. As exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation leads to skin cancer, the present study examined whether carvedilol can prevent UV-induced carcinogenesis. Carvedilol absorbs UV like a sunscreen; thus, to separate pharmacological from sunscreen effects, 4-hydroxycarbazole (4-OHC), which absorbs UV to the same degree as carvedilol, served as control. JB6 P+ cells, an established epidermal model for studying tumor promotion, were used for evaluating the effect of carvedilol on UV-induced neoplastic transformation. Both carvedilol and 4-OHC (1 mM) blocked transformation induced by chronic UV (15 mJ/cm(2)) exposure for eight weeks. However, EGF-mediated transformation was only inhibited by carvedilol but not by 4-OHC. Carvedilol (1 and 5 mM), but not 4-OHC, attenuated UV-induced AP-1 and NF-kB luciferase reporter activity, suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory activity. In a single dose UV (200 mJ/cm(2)) induced skin inflammation mouse model, carvedilol (10 mM), applied topically after UV exposure, reduced skin hyperplasia and the levels of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, IL-1β, IL-6, and COX-2 in skin. In SKH-1 mice exposed to gradually increasing levels of UV (50-150 mJ/cm(2)) three times a week for 25 weeks, topical administration of carvedilol (10 mM) after UV exposure increased tumor latency compared with control (week 18 vs. 15), decreased incidence and multiplicity of squamous cell carcinomas, while 4-OHC had no effect.  These data suggest that carvedilol has a novel chemopreventive activity and topical carvedilol following UV exposure may be repurposed for preventing skin inflammation and cancer.",

    "abstract": "There is a trend of increasing prevalence of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), and the inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome serves as a genetic model to investigate how NETs develop and the underlying mechanisms. Menin, encoded by the MEN1 gene, at least partly acts as a scaffold protein by interacting with multiple partners to regulate cellular homeostasis of various endocrine organs. Menin has multiple functions including regulating several important signaling pathways by controlling gene transcription. Here, we focus on reviewing the recent progress in elucidating the key biochemical role of menin in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription and cell signaling, as well as posttranslational regulation of menin itself. In particular, we will review the progress in studying structural and functional interactions of menin with various histone modifiers and transcription factors such as MLL, PRMT5, SUV39H1 and other transcription factors including c-Myb and JunD. Moreover, the role of menin in regulating cell signaling pathways such as TGF-beta, Wnt, and Hedgehog, as well as miRNA biogenesis and processing will be described. Further, the regulation of the MEN1 gene transcription, posttranslational modifications and stability of menin protein will be reviewed. These various modes of regulation by menin as well as regulation of menin by various biological factors broaden the view regarding how menin controls various biological processes in neuroendocrine organ homeostasis.",
